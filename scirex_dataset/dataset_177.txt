In O

GFR Task

involves O
more O

with O
the O
significant O

the O
difficulty O
of O
AIFR Task
where O
the O

Recent O
AIFR Task
researches O
primarily O
concentrate O
on O
two O
technical O
schemes O
: O
generative Method
scheme Method
and O
discriminative Method
scheme Method
. O
The O
generative Method
scheme Method
models O
the O
AIFR Task
by O
synthesizing O
faces O
to O
one O
or O
more O
fixed O
age O
category O
then O
performs O

with O
the O
artificial Method
face Method

. O
Benefited O
from O
the O
advancement O
of O
the O
deep Method
generative Method
model Method
, O
the O
generative Method
scheme Method
becomes O
more O
promising O
on O
AIFR Task
as O
well O
. O
However O
, O
the O
generative Method
scheme Method
still O
remains O
several O
significant O
shortcomings O
. O
Firstly O
, O
generative Method
scheme Method
usually O
separates O
the O
recognition Task
process O
into O
two O
steps O
. O
Hence O
it O
is O
not O
easy O
for O
the O
generative Method
models Method
to O
optimize O
recognition Task
performance O
in O
an O
end O
- O
to O
- O
end O
manner O
. O
Secondly O
, O
generation Method
models Method
are O
often O
unstable O
so O
the O
synthesizing O
face O
images O
will O
introduce O
additional O
noises O
, O
which O
may O
result O
in O
negative O
effects O
on O
the O
recognition Task
process O
. O
Moreover O
, O
constructing O
an O
accurate O
, O
parametric Method
generation Method
model Method
is O
fairly O
difficult O
since O
the O
aging Task
process Task
of O
humans O
’ O
face O
is O
easily O
impacted O
by O
many O
latent O
factors O
such O
as O
social O
environments O
, O
diet O
, O
etc O
. O
The O
discriminative Method

aims O
at O
constructing O
the O

The O
