Limitations	O
A	O
major	O
limitation	O
of	O
SegLink	Method
is	O
that	O
two	O
thresholds	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
need	O

be	O
set	O
manually	O

In	O

the	O
optimal	O
values	O

the	O
thresholds	O
are	O
found	O

Simplifying	O
the	O
parameters	O
would	O
be	O
part	O
of	O
our	O
future	O

Another	O
weakness	O
is	O
that	O
SegLink	Method
fails	O
to	O
detect	O
text	O
that	O
has	O
very	O
large	O

In	O
