Introduction O
Many O
natural Task
problems Task
in O
computer Task
vision Task
are O
instances O
of O
dense Task
prediction Task
. O
The O
goal O
is O
to O
compute O
a O
discrete O
or O
continuous O
label O
for O
each O
pixel O
in O
the O
image O
. O
A O
prominent O
example O
is O
semantic Task
segmentation Task
, O
which O
calls O
for O
classifying O
each O
pixel O
into O
one O
of O
a O
given O
set O
of O
categories O
. O
Semantic Task
segmentation Task
is O
challenging O
because O
it O
requires O
combining O
pixel Metric

accuracy Metric
with O
multi Method
- Method
scale Method
contextual Method

. O
Significant O
accuracy Metric
gains O
in O
semantic Task
segmentation Task
have O
recently O
been O
obtained O
through O
the O
use O
of O
convolutional Method

trained O
by O
backpropagation Method
. O
Specifically O
, O
showed O
that O
convolutional Method
network Method
architectures Method
that O
had O
originally O
been O
developed O
for O
image Task
classification Task
can O
be O
successfully O
repurposed O
for O
dense Task
prediction Task
. O
These O
reporposed Method
networks Method
substantially O
outperform O
the O
prior O
state O
of O
the O
art O
on O
challenging O
semantic Task
segmentation Task
benchmarks O
. O
This O
prompts O
new O
questions O
motivated O
by O
the O
structural O
differences O
between O
image Task
classification Task
and O
dense Task
prediction Task
. O
Which O
aspects O
of O
the O
repurposed Method
networks Method
are O
truly O
necessary O
and O
which O
reduce O
accuracy Metric
when O
operated O
densely O
? O
Can O
dedicated O
modules O
designed O
specifically O
for O
dense Task
prediction Task
improve O
accuracy Metric
further O
? O
Modern O
image Method
classification Method
networks Method
integrate O
multi O

scale O
contextual O
information O
via O
successive Method
pooling Method
and Method
subsampling Method
layers Method
that O
reduce O
resolution O
until O
a O
global Task
prediction Task
is O
obtained O
. O
In O
contrast O
, O
dense Task
prediction Task
calls O
for O
multi Task
- Task
scale Task
contextual Task
reasoning Task
in O
combination O
with O
full O
- O
resolution O
output O
. O
Recent O
work O
has O
studied O
two O
approaches O
to O
dealing O
with O
the O
conflicting O
demands O
of O
multi Task
- Task
scale Task
reasoning Task
and O
full Task
- Task
resolution Task
dense Task
prediction Task
. O
One O
approach O
involves O
repeated O
up Method
- Method
convolutions Method
that O
aim O
to O
recover O
lost O
resolution O
while O
carrying O
over O
the O
global O
perspective O
from O
downsampled O
layers O
. O
This O
leaves O
open O
the O
question O
of O
whether O
severe O
intermediate Task
downsampling Task
was O
truly O
necessary O
. O
Another O
approach O
involves O
providing O
multiple O
rescaled O
versions O
of O
the O
image O
as O
input O
to O
the O
network O
and O
combining O
the O
predictions O
obtained O
for O
these O
multiple O
inputs O
. O
Again O
, O
it O
is O
not O
clear O
whether O
separate O
analysis O
of O
rescaled O
input O
images O
is O
truly O
necessary O
. O
In O
this O
work O
, O
we O
develop O
a O
convolutional Method
network Method
module Method
that O
aggregates O
multi O
- O
scale O
contextual O
information O
without O
losing O
resolution O
or O
analyzing O
rescaled O
images O
. O
The O
module O
can O
be O
plugged O
into O
existing O
architectures O
at O
any O
resolution O
. O
Unlike O
pyramid Method

carried O
over O
from O
image Task
classification Task
, O
the O
presented O

module Method
is O
designed O
specifically O
for O
dense Task
prediction Task
. O
It O
is O
a O
rectangular Method
prism Method
of Method
convolutional Method
layers Method
, O
with O
no O
pooling Method
or O
subsampling Method
. O
The O
module O
is O
based O
on O
dilated Method
convolutions Method
, O
which O
support O
exponential Method
expansion Method
of Method
the Method
receptive Method
field Method
without O
loss O
of O
resolution O
or O
coverage O
. O
As O
part O
of O
this O
work O
, O
we O
also O
re O
- O
examine O
the O
performance O
of O
repurposed Method
image Method

on O
semantic Task

. O
The O
performance O
of O
the O
core Method

can O
be O
unintentionally O
obscured O

increasingly O

multi Method

, O
multiple O

. O
We O
therefore O
examine O
the O
leading O
adaptations O
of O
deep Method
image Method
classification Method
networks Method
in O
a O
controlled O
setting O
and O
remove O
vestigial Method
components Method
that O
hinder O
dense Task

performance O
. O
The O
result O
is O
an O
initial O
prediction Method
module Method
that O
is O
both O
simpler O
and O
more O
accurate O
than O
prior O
adaptations O
. O
Using O
the O

, O
we O
evaluate O
the O
presented O

through O
controlled O
experiments O
on O

The O

demonstrate O
that O

reliably O
increases O

The O

The O
input O

the O

thus O
the O
module O
can O
be O

We O
begin O
by O
describing O
a O

In O
this O
basic O
form O
, O
each O

The O

the O

directly O

although O
the O

not O

Intuitively O
, O
the O

increase O
the O
accuracy Metric
of O
the O
feature O

passing O
them O
through O
multiple O
layers O
that O
expose O

. O
The O
basic O
context Method

has O
7 O
layers O
that O
apply O

The O

these O

Each O

these O

A O

We O
therefore O

Our O
initial O
attempts O

an O

Experiments O
revealed O
that O
standard O

do O
not O

Convolutional Method

are O
commonly O

using O

However O
, O
we O
found O
that O

not O
effective O
for O
the O

We O
found O
an O
alternative O

much O
more O

where O

the O

This O
is O
a O
form O

which O

This O

sets O
all O

such O
that O
each O

the O

A O
natural O
concern O
is O
that O
this O

put O
the O
network O
in O
a O
mode O
where O
backpropagation Method
can O
not O
significantly O
improve O
the O

However O
, O

that O
this O

not O
the O
case O

Backpropagation Method
reliably O

the O

the O

This O

both O

Conclusion O
We O
have O
examined O
convolutional Method

for O
dense Task

. O
Since O
the O
model O
must O
produce O
high O
- O
resolution O
output O
, O
we O
believe O
that O
high O
- O
resolution O
operation O
throughout O
the O
network O
is O
both O
feasible O
and O
desirable O
. O
Our O
work O
shows O
that O
the O
dilated Method
convolution Method
operator Method
is O
particularly O
suited O
to O
dense Task
prediction Task
due O
to O
its O
ability O
to O
expand O
the O
receptive O

without O
losing O

or O
coverage O
. O
We O
have O
utilized O
dilated Method

to O
design O
a O
new O

that O
reliably O
increases O
accuracy Metric

As O

we O
have O
also O
shown O
that O
the O
accuracy Metric
of O
existing O

for O

can O
be O
increased O
by O
removing O
vestigial Method

that O
had O
been O

We O
believe O
that O
the O

is O
a O
step O
towards O
dedicated O
architectures O
for O
dense Task

that O
are O
not O
