Introduction O
Traditional O
face Task

aims O
to O
locate O
face O
fiducial O
points O
like O
“ O
eye O

” O
, O
“ O
nose O

” O
and O
“ O

” O
, O
based O
on O
which O
the O
face O

can O
be O
normalized O
. O
It O
is O
an O
essential O
preprocessing O
step O
for O
many O
face Task

tasks Task
, O
e.g. O
, O
face Task

, O

and O
inverse Task

. O
The O
researches O
in O
face Task
alignment Task
can O
be O
divided O
into O
two O
categories O
: O
the O
analysis Task
- Task
by Task
- Task
synthesis Task
based O
and O
regression Method
based Method
. O
The O
former O
simulates O
the O
process O
of O
image Task
generation Task
and O
achieves O
alignment Task
by O
minimizing O
the O
difference O
between O
model O

and O

. O
The O
latter O
extracts O
features O
around O
key O
points O
and O
regresses O
it O
to O
the O
ground O

. O
With O
the O
development O
in O
the O
last O
decade O
, O
face Task
alignment Task
across O
medium O
poses O
, O
where O
the O
yaw O
angle O
is O
less O
than O
and O
all O
the O
landmarks O
are O
visible O
, O
has O
been O
well O
addressed O
. O
However O
, O
face Task
alignment Task
across O
large O

( O
) O
is O
still O
a O
challenging O
problem O
without O
much O
attention O

. O
There O
are O
three O
main O
challenges O
: O
Modelling Method
: O
Landmark Method

implicitly O
assumes O
that O
each O
landmark O
can O
be O
robustly O
detected O
based O
on O
its O
distinctive O
visual O
patterns O
. O
However O
, O
when O
faces O
deviate O
from O
the O
frontal O
view O
, O
some O
landmarks O
become O
invisible O
due O
to O
self O
- O
occlusion O
. O
In O
medium O

, O
this O
problem O
can O
be O
addressed O
by O
changing O
the O
semantic O
positions O
of O
face O
contour O
landmarks O
to O
the O
silhouette O
, O
which O
is O
termed O
landmark Method

. O
However O
, O
in O
large O
poses O
where O
half O
of O
face O
is O
occluded O
, O
some O
landmarks O
are O
inevitably O
invisible O
and O
have O
no O

As O
a O

no O

than O

due O
to O
the O
dramatic O

when O

The O

not O

from O

Manual Task

a O
very O

task O

Firstly O
, O
no O

can O
provide O
a O

to O
reduce O
the O

Secondly O
, O
the O

have O
to O
be O
“ O

” O
which O

impossible O
for O
most O
of O
people O

As O
