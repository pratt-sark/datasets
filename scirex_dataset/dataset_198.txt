it O

which O

Each O

facial O

Therefore O
, O
landmarks O

the O

There O

Conclusion O
In O
this O
paper O

we O
have O
developed O
a O

is O
beneficial O
for O
reinforcing O
the O

In O
addition O
, O
we O
have O
proposed O
the O

to O
integrate O
multiple Method

, O
and O
have O
shown O
that O
our O
method O
exploits O
