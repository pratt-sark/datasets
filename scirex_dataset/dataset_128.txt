difficulty O

search Task

; O
the O
lack O
of O
regularity O
in O
the O

makes O
it O
difficult O

train O

the O
query O
to O
extract O
information O
that O
can O
help O

the O

the O
query O

One O
clear O
direction O
to O
improve O
query Task
processing Task
is O
to O
annotate O
a O
large O
number O
of O

with O
the O
desired O
annotation Method

. O
However O
, O
such O
an O
annotation O
can O
be O
prohibitively O
expensive O
and O
models O
trained O
on O
such O
queries O
might O
suffer O
from O
freshness O
issues O
, O
as O
the O
domain O
and O
nature O
of O
queries O
evolve O
frequently O
. O
Another O
direction O
is O
to O
obtain O
a O
paraphrase O
of O
the O
given O
query O
that O
is O
a O
grammatical O
natural O
language O
question O
, O
and O
then O
analyze O
that O
paraphrase O
to O
extract O
the O
required O
information O
. O
There O
are O
available O
tools O
and O
datasets O
, O
such O
as O
Quora O
question O
paraphrases O
and O
the O
Paralex O

, O
but O
these O

do O
not O
contain O
information O

Identifying Task

Identifying O
a O

question Task
should O
be O
easy O

parsing Method

a O

Thus O

in O

we O
present O
