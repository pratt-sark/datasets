To O
address O
these O
problems O
, O
in O
this O

we O
propose O
a O
novel O
instance Method
segmentation Method
network Method
, O
namely O
, O
Progressive Method
Scale Method
Expansion Method
Network Method
( O
PSENet Method
) O
. O
There O
are O
two O
advantages O
of O
the O
proposed O
PSENet Method
. O
Firstly O
, O
as O
a O
segmentation Method
- Method
based Method
method Method
, O
PSENet Method
is O
able O
to O
locate O
texts O
with O

. O
Secondly O
, O
we O
put O
forward O
a O
progressive Method
scale Method
expansion Method
algorithm Method
, O
with O
which O
the O
closely O
adjacent O
text O
instances O
can O
be O
identified O
successfully O
( O

[ O

( O

) O
) O
. O
Specifically O
, O
we O
assign O
each O
text O
instance O
with O
multiple O
predicted O
segmentation O
areas O
. O
For O
convenience O
, O
we O
denote O
these O
segmentation O
areas O
as O
“ O
kernels O
” O
in O
this O
paper O
and O
for O
one O
text O
instance O
, O
there O
are O
several O
corresponding O
kernels O
. O
Each O
of O
the O
kernels O
shares O
the O
similar O
shape O
with O
the O
original O
entire O
text O
instance O
, O
and O
they O
all O
locate O
at O
the O
same O
central O
point O
but O
differ O
in O
scales O
. O
To O
obtain O
the O
final O
detections O
, O
we O
adopt O
the O
progressive Method
scale Method
expansion Method
algorithm Method
. O
It O
is O
based O
on O
Breadth Method

Search Method
( O

) O
and O
is O
composed O
of O
3 O
steps O
: O

) O
starting O
from O
the O
kernels O
with O
minimal O
scales O
( O
instances O
can O
be O
distinguished O
in O
this O
step O
) O
; O

) O
expanding O
their O
areas O
by O
involving O
more O
pixels O
in O
larger O
kernels O
gradually O
; O
3 O
) O
finishing O
until O
the O
largest O
kernels O
are O
explored O
. O
The O
motivations O
of O
the O
progressive Method
scale Method
expansion Method
are O
mainly O
of O
four O
folds O
. O
Firstly O
, O
the O
kernels O
with O
minimal O
scales O
are O
quite O
easy O
to O
be O
separated O
as O
their O
boundaries O
are O
far O
away O
from O
each O
other O
. O
Therefore O
, O
it O
overcomes O
the O
major O
drawbacks O
of O
the O
previous O
segmentation Method
- Method
based Method
methods Method
; O
Secondly O
, O
the O
largest O
kernels O
or O
the O
complete O
areas O
of O
text O
instances O
are O
indispensable O
for O
achieving O
the O
final O
precise Task
detections Task
; O
Thirdly O
, O
the O
kernels O
are O
gradually O
growing O
from O
small O
to O
large O
scales O
, O
and O
thus O
the O
smoonth Method
surpervisions Method
would O
make O
the O
networks O
much O
easier O
to O
learn O
; O
Finally O
, O
the O
progressive Method
scale Method
expansion Method
algorithm Method
ensures O
the O
accurate O
locations O
of O
text O
instances O
as O
their O
boundaries O
are O
expanded O
in O
a O
careful O
and O
gradual O
manner O
. O
To O
show O
the O
effectiveness O
of O
our O
proposed O
PSENet Method
, O
we O
conduct O
extensive O
experiments O
on O
three O
competitive O

we O

four O

These O

further O

such O

the O
