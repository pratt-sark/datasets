We O
propose O
to O
remedy O
this O

by O
casting O

as O
the O
problem O
of O

We O
then O
define O

as O
the O

or O
, O
alternatively O
, O
as O
sinks O
“ O

We O
argue O
–and O
prove O
empirically O
in O
our O
experiments– O
that O
this O
approach O
leads O
to O
more O
robust O
localization Task
and O
better O
connectivity O
between O

We O
also O
argue O
that O
considering O
a O

is O
sufficient O
, O
consistent O
with O
past O
approaches O

binary Task

Whereas O
predicting O

allow O

Our O

that O

On O

that O
