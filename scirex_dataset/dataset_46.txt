which O

the O

Images O

Since O

they O

However O
, O
the O

Introduction O
Face Task

have O
been O
well O

widely O
used O
in O
computer Task

applications Task
such O
as O
financial Task

and O

. O
Both O
the O
two O
tasks O
need O
to O
measure O
the O
distance O
between O
two O

images O
. O
Such O
tasks O
can O
be O
naturally O
formalized O
as O
a O
metric Task

problem Task
, O
where O
the O
distance O
of O
images O
from O
the O

identity O
should O
be O
smaller O
than O
that O

current O
methods O
can O

performance O
on O

, O
but O
may O
still O
fail O
due O
to O
appearance O
variations O
caused O
by O
large O

or O

. O
In O
practical O
applications O
, O
instead O
of O
one O
single O
image O
, O
a O
set O
of O
images O
for O
each O
identity O
can O
always O
be O
collected O
. O
For O
example O
, O
the O
image O
set O
of O
one O
identity O
can O
be O
sampled O
from O
the O
trajectory O
of O
the O

or O
person O
in O
videos O
. O
Images O
in O
a O
set O
can O
be O
complementary O
to O
each O
other O
, O
so O
that O
they O
provide O
more O
information O
than O
a O
single O
image O
, O
such O
as O
images O
from O
different O
poses O
. O
The O
direct O

aggregate O

from O
all O

in O
a O

can O
be O
simply O

. O
However O
, O
one O
problem O
in O
this O

is O
that O
some O
images O
in O
the O

may O
be O
not O
suitable O
for O

the O

In O

described O
above O
and O
simultaneously O
use O
the O
rich O
information O
provided O
by O

, O
our O
basic O
idea O
is O
that O
each O

can O
have O
a O
quality Metric

in O

. O
For O
that O
, O
we O
propose O
a O

( O
QAN Method

, O
which O
has O
two O

The O

Features O

then O
aggregated O

according O

their O

A O
good O
property O
of O
our O
approach O
is O
that O
we O
do O
not O
supervise O
the O
model O
by O
any O
explicit O

of O
the O

The O
network O
can O
automatically O
assign O

we O
use O

The O

Looking O
backward O
, O
there O
are O
two O
different O
approaches O
handling O

The O
first O
approach O
takes O

The O
most O
famous O
approach O
in O
this O
kind O
is O
the O
Bag O

which O
uses O

Another O
classical O
work O
is O

This O
method O
uses O
the O
1st O

The O

classified O
into O
20 O
bins O
based O
on O

pose O

Then O
faces O

each O
bin O
are O
pooled O

generate O

finally O

all O

The O

to O
the O
second O

It O

the O

In O

that O

Let O

The O

Based O

It O

and O

the O

We O
theoretically O

demonstrate O
that O
the O

beneficial O
to O

better O

QAN Method

However O
