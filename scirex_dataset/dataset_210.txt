Introduction O
A O
key O
challenge O
in O
visual Task

is O
how O
to O
accommodate O
geometric O
variations O
or O
model O
geometric O
transformations O
in O

, O

, O

, O
and O

. O
In O
general O
, O
there O
are O
two O
ways O
. O
The O
first O
is O
to O
build O
the O
training O
datasets O
with O
sufficient O
desired O
variations O
. O
This O
is O
usually O
realized O
by O
augmenting O
the O
existing O
data O

, O
, O
by O
affine Method

. O
Robust Method
representations Method
can O
be O
learned O
from O
the O
data O
, O
but O
usually O
at O
the O
cost O
of O
expensive O
training O
and O
complex O
model O
parameters O
. O
The O
second O
is O
to O
use O
transformation O
- O
invariant O
features O
and O
algorithms O
. O
This O
category O
subsumes O
many O
well O
known O
techniques O
, O
such O
as O
SIFT Method
( Method
scale Method
invariant Method
feature Method

) O
and O
sliding O
window O
based O
object Task
detection Task
paradigm O
. O
There O
are O
two O
drawbacks O
in O
above O
ways O
. O
First O
, O
the O
geometric O
transformations O
are O
assumed O
fixed O
and O
known O
. O
Such O
prior O
knowledge O
is O
used O
to O
augment O
the O
data O
, O
and O
design O
the O
features Method
and Method
algorithms Method
. O
This O
assumption O
prevents O
generalization Task
to O
new O
tasks O
possessing O
unknown O
geometric O
transformations O
, O
which O
are O
not O
properly O
modeled O
. O
Second O
, O
hand O
- O
crafted O
design O
of O
invariant Method
features Method
and Method
algorithms Method
could O
be O
difficult O
or O
infeasible O
for O
overly O
complex O
transformations O
, O
even O
when O
they O
are O
known O
. O
Recently O
, O

have O
achieved O
significant O

, O
such O
as O

, O
semantic Task

, O
and O
object Task

. O
Nevertheless O
, O
they O
still O
share O
the O
above O
two O
drawbacks O
. O
Their O
capability O
of O

mostly O
comes O
from O

In O
short O
, O
CNNs Method
are O
inherently O

The O
limitation O
originates O
from O

a O

a O
RoI O

) O
pooling Method

separates O
a O
RoI O

fixed O
spatial O

, O
etc O
. O
There O
lacks O
internal O
mechanisms O
to O
handle O
the O
geometric O

. O
This O
causes O
noticeable O
problems O

For O
one O

the O

all O

This O
is O
undesirable O
for O
high Method

CNN Method

that O
encode O

Because O

For O

all O

The O
first O
is O

It O
adds O
2D O

It O

The O
offsets O
are O
learned O
from O
the O
preceding O
feature O

Thus O
, O
the O

is O
conditioned O
on O
the O
input O

in O
a O
local O

dense O
, O
and O

The O
second O
is O
deformable Method
RoI Method
pooling Method
. O
It O
adds O
an O
offset O
to O
each O
bin O
position O
in O
the O
regular O

partition O
of O
the O
previous O
RoI Method

Similarly O
, O
the O

are O

RoIs O

Both O

are O

They O
add O

They O

The O

CNNs Method

Our O
approach O

They O
all O

such O

purely O

A O
key O

that O
