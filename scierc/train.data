a O

to O

proposed O

The O
basic O
assumption O
is O
that O
the O

lies O
on O
a O
low O

and O
can O
be O
learned O
from O

Based O

firstly O
we O
derived O
the O

the O

Secondly O
the O

on O
this O
intrinsic O

Thirdly O
the O
learned O
intrinsic O

is O
integrated O
into O
a O

We O
will O
show O
that O
this O
intrinsic O

has O
some O
interesting O
properties O
and O
based O
on O
which O
the O
newly O
derived O
dynamical O
model O
makes O

Experiments O

that O
the O

we O

one O

To O

we O
incorporate O

Extensive O

have O
demonstrated O
the O
superiority O

our O

In O
this O
paper O
, O
we O
aim O
to O
automatically O

a O

way O

Basically O
, O
a O
set O

age-group O

are O

, O
where O
the O

bases O

a O

Moreover O
, O
two O
factors O
are O
taken O

in O
the O

. O

First O
, O
beyond O
the O

dictionaries O
, O
each O

may O
have O
extra O

, O
e.g. O

, O
which O
are O

in O
the O

. O

Second O
, O
it O
is O
challenging O
or O
even O
impossible O
to O
collect O
faces O
of O
all O
age O
groups O
for O
a O
particular O
subject O
, O
yet O
much O
easier O

more O
practical O
to O
get O

Thus O
a O

advantages O

First O

we O
directly O

Third O
, O
regarding O

, O
we O
use O
a O
very O
small O

-LRB- O

one O
of O
the O
most O
difficult O
tasks O
in O
developing O
a O

, Task
is O
expensive O

To O
avoid O
this O
problem O
, O
we O
investigate O
how O
we O
build O
a O

using O
existing O

Our O

can O
be O

for O
the O

we O
focus O
on O
building O
a O
Korean-to-Japanese O

We O
attempt O
three O
ways O
of O

to O
corroborate O
the O

First O
, O
we O
introduce O

, O
we O

a O

using O
`` O

Third O
, O
we O
consider O
another O
alternative O
method O
rarely O
used O
for O
building O
a O

: O
an O

We O
found O
that O
the O
first O
method O
is O
the O
most O

the O

be O
obtained O

We O

In O
our O

the O

Semi-Riemannian O

A O

The O

However O
, O

In O

our O

We O

Then O

this O

in O
a O
Bayesian O
test O

decides O
whether O

corrupting O
the O

It O
allows O
us O

estimate O
their O

In O
this O
way O
, O
the O

can O
be O
discarded O

Our O

a O

We O

Although O

it O

The O

In O

we O

Previous O

that O

In O
fact O
, O
for O
these O

We O
describe O

A O

a O

The O

that O

we O
obtain O
segmentations O

This O

by O

This O

This O

These O

Consequently O

in O
this O

In O

The O

Furthermore O

we O

We O

The O

so O
we O
use O

Extensive O

The O

We O
propose O
a O

bispectral Method

that O

One O
of O
the O
important O

fluorescence O
is O
its O
wavelength-shifting O
behavior O
: O
fluorescent O
materials O
absorb O
light O
at O
a O
certain O

Due O

In O

show O
that O

a O

that O

Moreover O

The O
objective O
of O
this O
project O
is O
to O
develop O
a O
robust O
and O
high-performance O
speech O
recognition O
system O
using O
a O
segment-based O
approach O
to O

. O

The O

system O
will O
eventually O
be O
integrated O
with O
natural O

to O
achieve O
spoken O

understanding O

Spelling-checkers Task
have O
become O
an O
integral O

. O

From O
different O
reasons O
among O
which O
the O
speed O
of O

prevails O
they O
are O
usually O
based O
on O
dictionaries O
of O

instead O
of O
words O
. Generic

This O
approach O
is O
sufficient O
for O
languages O
with O
little O
inflection O
such O
as O
English O
, O
but O
fails O
for O
highly O
inflective O
languages O
such O
as O
Czech O
, O
Russian O
, O
Slovak O
or O
other O
Slavonic O
languages O
. O

We O
have O
developed O
a O
special O
method O
for O
describing O
inflection O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
building O
spelling-checkers O
for O
such O
languages O
. O

The O
speed O
of O
the O
resulting O
program O
lies O
somewhere O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
scale O
of O
existing O

for O

the O
main O

whereas O
the O
number O
of O

exceeds O

Further O
, O
a O
special O
method O
has O
been O
developed O
for O
easy O

We O
present O
a O

that O
exploits O

both O

a O

be O

and O
evaluate O
it Generic
in O
both O

Along O
the O
way O
, O
we O
present O
the O
first O
comprehensive O

noting O
that O
published O
results O

have O
not O

Observing O
that O
the O

of O
the O

greatly O
impacts O
the O

by O

we O

a O
method O

Finally O
, O
we O
show O
how O
this O

achieves O

This O
paper O

a O

The O
basic O
goal O
in O
building O
that O
editor O
was O
to O
provide O
an O
adequate O
tool O
to O
help O
lexicologists O
produce O
a O
valid Method
and O
coherent O
dictionary O
on O
the O
basis O

If O
we O
want O
valuable O
lexicons O

we O
must O
provide O
very O
powerful O
tools O
to O
help O
create O
and O
ensure O
the O

of O
such O
complex O
linguistic O

. O

Our O
most O
important O
task O
in O
building O
the O
editor O
was O
to O
define O
a O
set O
of O
coherence O
rules O
that O
could O
be O
computationally O
applied O
to O
ensure O
the O
validity O
of O
lexical O

. O

A O
customized O
interface O
for O

was O
also O
designed O
and O
implemented O

Existing O
techniques O
extract O

candidates O
by O
looking O
for O
internal OtherScientificTerm
and OtherScientificTerm
contextual OtherScientificTerm
information OtherScientificTerm
associated O
with O
domain OtherScientificTerm
specific OtherScientificTerm
terms OtherScientificTerm
. O

The O
algorithms O
always O
face O
the O
dilemma O
that O
fewer O
features O
are O
not O
enough O
to O
distinguish O
terms O
from O
non-terms O
whereas O
more O
features O
lead O
to O
more O
conflicts O
among O
selected O
features OtherScientificTerm
. O

This O
paper O
presents O
a O
novel O
approach O
for O
term O
extraction O
based O
on O
delimiters O
which O
are O
much O
more O
stable O
and O
domain O
independent O
. O

The O
proposed O
approach O
is O
not O
as O
sensitive O
to O
term O
frequency O
as O
that O
of O
previous O
works O
. O

This O
approach O
has O
no O
strict O
limit O
or O
hard O
rules O
and O
thus O
they O
can O
deal O
with O
all O
kinds O
of O
terms O
. O

It O
also O
requires O
no O
prior O
domain O
knowledge O
and O
no O
additional O
training O
to O
adapt O
to O
new O
domains O
. O

Consequently O
, O
the O
proposed O
approach O
can O
be O
applied O
to O
different O
domains O
easily O
and O
it O
is O
especially O
useful O
for O
resource-limited O
domains O
. O

Evaluations O
conducted O
on O
two O
different O
domains O
for O
Chinese O

extraction O
show O
significant O
improvements O
over O
existing O
techniques O
which O
verifies O
its O
efficiency O
and O
domain O
independent O
nature O
. O

Experiments O
on O
new O
term O
extraction O
indicate O
that O
the O
proposed O
approach O
can O
also O
serve O
as O
an O
effective O
tool O
for O

In O

In O

how O

We O
relax O
the O

two O

the O

By O
those O

we O

Our O
system O
is O
suitable O
for O
embedded O
computer O

based O
on O
three O
reasons O
. O

Firstly O
, O
the O

Secondly O
, O
we O
use O

We O
address O
the O

the O

HMHH O
not O
only O
provides O
rich O
motion O

, O
but O
also O
remains O
computationally O

Finally O
, O
we O
combine O
MHI O
and O
HMHH O
together O
and O
extract O
a O
low O

vector O
to O
be O

the O

Experimental O

our O

The O

Experimental O

our O
hypothesis O

We O
attempt O
to O
understand O
visual Task

humans O

both O
psy-chophysical Method

Frontal O

Human O

were O

Several O

were O
used O
on O
the O

classification O
task O
using O
the O
Principal O
Components O
of O
the O

and O
flowfield O

of O
the O

The O
classification O

the O

was O
estimated O

the O

the O

also O

We O
then O
correlated O

Our O

suggest O
that O
human O

can O
be O
modeled O

some O
hyperplane O

used O

For O

the O

Instead O
of O

we O
introduce O
a O

The O
advantage O
of O
this O
novel O

is O
that O
it O
clusters O
all O

augmenting O

Also O

the O

Our O

The O

i.e. O
, O
it O
produces O
the O

It O

it O

Although O
