The O

The O

The O

This O

the O

It O
begins O
with O
a O
characterization O

how O
it O
can O

The O

to O
keep O

so O
several O

Since O

In O

we O

To O
this O
end O
, O
we O
propose O
to O
efficiently O
locate O

to O
pixelwise O
object O
probability O
, O
rather O
than O
measuring O
the O

We O
formulate O
the O

a O
generative O
proba-bilistic O
model O
such O
that O
object O

different O

can O
be O

by O

The O
new O
approach O
has O
three O
main O
advantages O
. O

First O
, O
it O
helps O
the O
object O

handle O
objects O

different O

Second O
, O
as O
the O
shapes O
of O
the O

may O
vary O
to O
fit O
the O

, O
the O
resulting O
proposals O
are O
tighter O
than O
the O
sampling O
windows O
with O
fixed O
sizes O
. O

Third O
, O
it O
avoids O
massive O
window O
sampling O
, O
and O
thereby O
reducing O
the O
number O
of O
proposals O
while O
maintaining O
a O
high O

The O
