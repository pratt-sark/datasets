an O

To O

The O

An O

The O

the O

present O

We O

We O

We O

the O

In O
this O
theory O
, O
discourse O

is O
composed O
of O
three O

components O
: O
the O

-LRB- OtherScientificTerm

the O

-RRB- O

The O
linguistic O
structure O
consists O
of O
segments O
of O
the O
discourse O
into O
which O
the O

naturally O
aggregate O
. O

The O
intentional O
structure O
captures O
the O

purposes O
, O
expressed O
in O
each O
of O
the O
linguistic O
segments O
as O

The O
attentional O

an O

such O

The O

This O
theory O
provides O
a O
framework O
for O
describing O
the O
processing O
of O

in O
a O

. O

Discourse O
processing O
requires O
recognizing O
how O
the O

aggregate O

recognizing O
the O
