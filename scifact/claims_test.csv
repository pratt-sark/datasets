"1,000 genomes project enables mapping of genetic sequence variation consisting of rare variants with larger penetrance effects than common variants.","We propose as an alternative explanation that variants much less common than the associated one may create ""synthetic associations"" by occurring, stochastically, more often in association with one of the alleles at the common site versus the other allele. We show that they are not only possible, but inevitable, and that under simple but reasonable genetic models, they are likely to account for or contribute to many of the recently identified signals reported in genome-wide association studies.",SUPPORT

Women with a higher birth weight are more likely to develop breast cancer later in life.,"Relative to women who weighed 3.000-3.499 kg, the risk was 0.96 (CI 0.80-1.16) in those who weighed < 2.500 kg, and 1.12 (95% CI 1.00-1.25) in those who weighed > or = 4.000 kg (p for linear trend = 0.001) in birth record data.",SUPPORT
Women with a higher birth weight are more likely to develop breast cancer later in life.,"The majority of studies identified a positive link between birthweight and premenopausal, but not postmenopausal, breast cancer.",SUPPORT
Women with a higher birth weight are more likely to develop breast cancer later in life.,The relative risk estimate for breast cancer comparing women with high birthweight to women with low birthweight combining all studies including both pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer was 1.23 (95% confidence interval 1.13-1.34).,SUPPORT
Women with a higher birth weight are more likely to develop breast cancer later in life.,"Increased risk of breast cancer was noted with increased birthweight (relative risk [RR] 1.15 [95% CI 1.09-1.21]), birth length (1.28 [1.11-1.48]), higher maternal age (1.13 [1.02-1.25]), and paternal age (1.12 [1.05-1.19]).",SUPPORT
Women with a higher birth weight are more likely to develop breast cancer later in life.,"RESULTS We found that heavier birth weights were associated with increased breast cancer risk, with studies involving five categories of birth weight identifying odds ratios (ORs) of 1.24 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04 to 1.48) for 4,000 g or more and 1.15 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.26) for 3,500 g to 3,999 g, relative to a birth weight of 2,500 to 2,599 g. These studies provided no support for a J-shaped relationship of birthweight to risk.",SUPPORT
aPKCz causes tumour enhancement by affecting glutamine metabolism.,"Interestingly, the loss of PKCζ in mice results in enhanced intestinal tumorigenesis and increased levels of these two metabolic enzymes, whereas patients with low levels of PKCζ have a poor prognosis.",CONTRADICT
aPKCz causes tumour enhancement by affecting glutamine metabolism.,"Taken together, this demonstrates that PKCζ is a critical metabolic tumor suppressor in mouse and human cancer.",CONTRADICT
cSMAC formation enhances weak ligand signalling.,This conclusion was supported by experiments that showed that enhancing cSMAC formation reduced stimulatory capacity of the weak peptide.,SUPPORT
mTORC2 regulates intracellular cysteine levels through xCT inhibition.,"mTORC2 phosphorylates serine 26 at the cytosolic N terminus of xCT, inhibiting its activity. Genetic inhibition of mTORC2, or pharmacologic inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase, promotes glutamate secretion, cystine uptake, and incorporation into glutathione, linking growth factor receptor signaling with amino acid uptake and utilization.",SUPPORT
