Image composition (or mosaicing) has attracted a growing attention in recent years as one of the main elements in video analysis and representation. In this paper we deal with the problem of global alignment and super-resolution. We also propose to evaluate the quality of the resulting mosaic by measuring the amount of blurring. Global registration is achieved by combining a graph-based technique – that exploits the topological structure of the sequence induced by the spatial overlap – with a bundle adjustment which uses only the homographies computed in the previous steps. Experimental comparison with other techniques shows the effectiveness of our approach.
