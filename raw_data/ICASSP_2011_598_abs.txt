In this paper we evaluate four objective measures of speech with regards to intelligibility prediction of synthesized speech in diverse noisy situations. We evaluated three intel-ligibility measures, the Dau measure, the glimpse proportion and the Speech Intelligibility Index (SII) and a quality measure , the Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ). For the generation of synthesized speech we used a state of the art HMM-based speech synthesis system. The noisy conditions comprised four additive noises. The measures were compared with subjective intelligibility scores obtained in listening tests. The results show the Dau and the glimpse measures to be the best predictors of intelligibility, with correlations of around 0.83 to subjective scores. All measures gave less accurate predictions of intelligibility for synthetic speech than have previously been found for natural speech; in particular the SII measure. In additional experiments, we processed the synthesized speech by an ideal binary mask before adding noise. The Glimpse measure gave the most accurate intelligibility predictions in this situation.
