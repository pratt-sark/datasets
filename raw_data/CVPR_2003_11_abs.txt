The features based on Markov random field (MRF) models are usually sensitive to the rotation of image textures. This paper develops an anisotropic circular Gaussian MRF (ACGMRF) model for modelling rotated image textures and retrieving rotation-invariant texture features. To overcome the singularity problem of the least squares estimate (LSE) method, an approximate least squares estimate (ALSE) method is proposed to estimate the parameters of the ACGMRF model. The rotation-invariant features can be obtained from the parameters of the ACGMRF model by the one-dimensional (1-D) discrete Fourier transform (DFT). Significantly improved accuracy can be achieved by applying the rotation-invariant features to classify SAR (synthetic aperture radar) sea ice and Brodatz imagery.
