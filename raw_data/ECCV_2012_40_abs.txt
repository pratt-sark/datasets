In this paper, we introduce KAZE features, a novel multiscale 2D feature detection and description algorithm in nonlinear scale spaces. Previous approaches detect and describe features at different scale levels by building or approximating the Gaussian scale space of an image. However, Gaussian blurring does not respect the natural boundaries of objects and smoothes to the same degree both details and noise, reducing localization accuracy and distinctiveness. In contrast, we detect and describe 2D features in a nonlinear scale space by means of nonlinear diffusion filtering. In this way, we can make blurring locally adaptive to the image data, reducing noise but retaining object boundaries, obtaining superior localization accuracy and distinctiviness. The nonlinear scale space is built using efficient Additive Operator Splitting (AOS) techniques and variable con-ductance diffusion. We present an extensive evaluation on benchmark datasets and a practical matching application on deformable surfaces. Even though our features are somewhat more expensive to compute than SURF due to the construction of the nonlinear scale space, but comparable to SIFT, our results reveal a step forward in performance both in detection and description against previous state-of-the-art methods.
