Trusting SVM for Piecewise Linear CNNs,"We present a novel layerwise optimization algorithm for the learning objective of Piecewise-Linear Convolutional Neural Networks (PL-CNNs), a large class of convolutional neural networks. Specifically, PL-CNNs employ piecewise linear non-linearities such as the commonly used ReLU and max-pool, and an SVM classifier as the final layer. The key observation of our approach is that the prob- lem corresponding to the parameter estimation of a layer can be formulated as a difference-of-convex (DC) program, which happens to be a latent structured SVM. We optimize the DC program using the concave-convex procedure, which requires us to iteratively solve a structured SVM problem. This allows to design an opti- mization algorithm with an optimal learning rate that does not require any tuning. Using the MNIST, CIFAR and ImageNet data sets, we show that our approach always improves over the state of the art variants of backpropagation and scales to large data and large network settings.","This paper proposes a new approaches for optimizing the objective of CNNs. The proposed method uses a lay-wise optimization, i.e. at each step, it optimizes the parameters in one layer of CNN while fixing the parameters in other layers. The key insight of this paper is that, for a large class of CNNs, the optimization problem at a particular can be formulated as optimizing a piecewise linear (PL) function. This PL function optimization happens to be the optimization problem commonly encountered in latent structural SVM. This connection allows this paper to borrows ideas from the latent structural SVM literature, in particular concave-convex procedure, to learn the parameters of CNNs.

Overall, the paper is well-written. Traditional, CNNs and structural SVMs are almost two separate research communties. The connection of CNNs to latent structural SVM is interesting, and might bridge the gap and facilitate the transferring of ideas between these two camps.

Of course, the proposed method also has some limitations. 1) It is limited to layer-wise optimization. Nowadays layer-wise optimization is essentially a coordinate descent algorithm and is not really a competitive strategy in learning CNNs. When you choose layer-wise optimization, you already lose something in terms of optimizing the objective (since you are using coordinate descent, instead of gradient descent). Of course, you also gain something since now you can guarantee that each coordinate descent step always improve the objective. It is not clear to me how the loss/gain balances each other. 2) This paper focues on improving the optimization of CNN objective. However, we all know that a better objective does not necessarily correspond to a good model (e.g. due to overfitting). Although the SGD with backprop in standard CNN learning does not always improve the solution of the objective (unlike the proposed method in this paper), but to me, this might be a good thing since it can prevent overfitting (the goal of learning is not to get better solution for the optimization problem in the first place -- the optimization problem is merely a proxy to learn a model with good generalization ability).

The experiment is a bit weak.
1) Only CIFAR10 is used. This is a very small dataset by today's standard, while CNNs are typically used in large-scale datasets, such as ImageNet. It is not clear whether the conclusions of this paper still hold when applied on ImageNet.

2) This paper only compares with a crippled variant of SGD (without batch normalization, dropout, etc). Although this paper mentions that the reason is that it wants to focus on optimization. But I mentioned earlier, SGD is not designed to purely obtain the best solution that optimizes the objective, the goal of SGD is to reasonably optimize the objective, while preventing overfitting. So the comparison to SGD purely in terms of the optimization is that meaningful in the first place.
