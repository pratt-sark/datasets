Efficient Vector Representation for Documents through Corruption,"We present an efficient document representation learning framework, Document Vector through Corruption (Doc2VecC). Doc2VecC represents each document as a simple average of word embeddings. It ensures a representation generated as such captures the semantic meanings of the document during learning. A corruption model is included, which introduces a data-dependent regularization that favors informative or rare words while forcing the embeddings of common and non-discriminative ones to be close to zero. Doc2VecC produces significantly better word embeddings than Word2Vec. We compare Doc2VecC with several state-of-the-art document representation learning algorithms. The simple model architecture introduced by Doc2VecC matches or out-performs the state-of-the-art in generating high-quality document representations for sentiment analysis, document classification as well as semantic relatedness tasks. The simplicity of the model enables training on billions of words per hour on a single machine. At the same time, the model is very efficient in generating representations of unseen documents at test time.","This paper discusses a method for computing vector representations for documents by using a skip-gram style learning mechanism with an added regularizer in the form of a global context vector with various bits of drop out. While none of the individual components proposed in this paper are new, I believe that the combination in this fashion is. Further, I appreciated the detailed analysis of model behaviour in section 3.

The main downside to this submission is in its relative weakness on the empirical front. Arguably there are more interesting tasks than sentiment analysis and k-way classification! Likewise, why waste 2/3 of a page on t-sne projections rather than use that space for further analysis?

While I am a bit disappointed by this reduced evaluation and agree with the other reviewers concerning soft baselines, I think this paper should be accepted: it's an interesting algorithm, nicely composed and very efficient, so it's reasonable to assume that other readers might have use for some of the ideas presented here.","{'SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS': 4, 'CLARITY': 5}"

The main idea is to represent a document as an average of its word embeddings with a data-dependent regularization that favors informative or rare words while forcing common words to be close to 0. 
Experiments on sentiment analysis and document classification show that the proposed method has the lowest error rates compared to baseline document embedding methods. 

While I like the motivation of finding the best way to encode a document into a vector, the paper does not offer significant technical contributions.
Most of the techniques are not new, and the main selling point is the simplicity and speed of the proposed method. 
For this reason, I would like to see good results for more than two tasks to be convinced that this is the best way to learn document representations.  
For RNN-LM, is the LM trained to minimize classification error, or is it trained  as a language model? Did you use the final hidden state as the representation, or the average of all hidden states?
One of the most widely used method to represent documents now is to have a bidirectional LSTM and concatenate the final hidden states as the document representation. 
I think it would be useful to know how the proposed method compares to this approach for tasks such as document classification or sentiment analysis.",{'CLARITY': 5}

While none of the pieces of this model are particularly novel, the result is an efficient learning algorithm for document representation with good empirical performance.

Joint training of word and document embeddings is not a new idea, nor is the idea of enforcing the document to be represented by the sum of its word embeddings (see, e.g. '“The Sum of Its Parts”: Joint Learning of Word and Phrase Representations with Autoencoders' by Lebret and Collobert). Furthermore, the corruption mechanism is nothing other than traditional dropout on the input layer. Coupled with the word2vec-style loss and training methods, this paper offers little on the novelty front.

On the other hand, it is very efficient at generation time, requiring only an average of the word embeddings rather than a complicated inference step as in Doc2Vec. Moreover, by construction, the embedding captures salient global information about the document -- it captures specifically that information that aids in local-context prediction. For such a simple model, the performance on sentiment analysis and document classification is quite encouraging.

Overall, despite the lack of novelty, the simplicity, efficiency, and performance of this model make it worthy of wider readership and study, and I recommend acceptance.","{'SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS': 5, 'CLARITY': 4}"
