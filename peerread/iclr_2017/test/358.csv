Towards a Neural Statistician,"An efficient learner is one who reuses what they already know to tackle a new problem. For a machine learner, this means understanding the similarities amongst datasets. In order to do this, one must take seriously the idea of working with datasets, rather than datapoints, as the key objects to model. Towards this goal, we demonstrate an extension of a variational autoencoder that can learn a method for computing representations, or statistics, of datasets in an unsupervised fashion. The network is trained to produce statistics that encapsulate a generative model for each dataset. Hence the network enables efficient learning from new datasets for both unsupervised and supervised tasks. We show that we are able to learn statistics that can be used for: clustering datasets, transferring generative models to new datasets, selecting representative samples of datasets and classifying previously unseen classes. We refer to our model as a neural statistician, and by this we mean a neural network that can learn to compute summary statistics of datasets without supervision.","Sorry for the late review -- I've been having technical problems with OpenReview which prevented me from posting.

This paper presents a method for learning to predict things from sets of data points. The method is a hierarchical version of the VAE, where the top layer consists of an abstract context unit that summarizes a dataset. Experiments show that the method is able to ""learn to learn"" by acquiring the ability to learn distributions from small numbers of examples.

Overall, this paper is a nice addition to the literature on one- or few-shot learning. The method is conceptually simple and elegant, and seems to perform well. Compared to other recent papers on one-shot learning, the proposed method is simpler, and is based on unsupervised representation learning. The paper is clearly written and a pleasure to read.

The name of the paper is overly grandiose relative to what was done; the proposed method doesn’t seem to have much in common with a statistician, unless one means by that ""someone who thinks up statistics"". 

The experiments are well chosen, and the few-shot learning results seem pretty solid given the simplicity of the method.

The spatial MNIST dataset is interesting and might make a good toy benchmark. The inputs in Figure 4 seem pretty dense, though; shouldn’t the method be able to recognize the distribution with fewer samples?  (Nitpick: the red points in Figure 4 don’t seem to correspond to meaningful points as was claimed in the text.) 

Will the authors release the code?

Comments:

- It's not clear to me why this should be called a ""statistician"". Learning an approximate posterior over summary statistics is not the only imaginable way to summarize a dataset with a neural network. One could consider a maximum likelihood approach, etc. In general it felt like the paper could be more clear, if it avoided coining new terms like ""statistic network"" and stuck to the more accurate ""approximate posterior"".

- The experiments are nice, and I appreciate the response to my question regarding ""one shot generation"". I still think that language needs to be clarified, specifically at the end of page 6. My understanding of Figure 5 is the following: Take an input set, compute the approximate posterior over the context vector, then generate from the forward model given samples from the approximate posterior. I would like clarification on the following: 

(a) Are the data point dependent vectors z generated from the forward model or taken from the approximate posterior? 

(b) I agree that the samples are of high-quality, but that is not a quantified statement. The advantage of VAEs over GANs is that we have natural ways of computing log-probabilities. To that end, one ""proper"" way of computing the ""one shot generation"" performance is to report log p(x | c) (where c is sampled from the approximate posterior) or log p(x) for held-out datasets. I suspect that log probability performance of these networks relative to a vanilla VAE without the context latent variable will be impressive. I still don't see a reason not to include that.",{'CLARITY': 3}
