Tree-structured decoding with doubly-recurrent neural networks,"We propose a neural network architecture for generating tree-structured objects from encoded representations. The core of the method is a doubly-recurrent neural network that models separately the width and depth recurrences across the tree, and combines them inside each cell to generate an output. The topology of the tree is explicitly modeled, allowing the network to predict both content and topology of the tree when decoding. That is, given only an encoded vector representation, the network is able to simultaneously generate a tree from it and predict labels for the nodes. We test this architecture in an encoder-decoder framework, where we train a network to encode a sentence as a vector, and then generate a tree structure from it. The experimental results show the effectiveness of this architecture at recovering latent tree structure in sequences and at mapping sentences to simple functional programs.","This paper proposes a variant of a recurrent neural network that has two orthogonal temporal dimensions that can be used as a decoder to generate tree structures (including the topology) in an encoder-decoder setting. The architecture is well motivated and I can see several applications (in addition to what's presented in the paper) that need to generate tree structures given an unstructured data.

One weakness of the paper is the limitation of experiments. IFTTT dataset seems to be an interesting appropriate application, and there is also a synthetic dataset, however it would be more interesting to see more natural language applications with syntactic tree structures. Still, I consider the experiments sufficient as a first step to showcase a novel architecture.

A strength is that the authors experiment with different design decisions when building the topology predictor components of the architecture, about when / how to decide to terminate, as opposed to making a single arbitrary choice.

I see future applications of this architecture and it seems to have interesting directions for future work so I suggest its acceptance as a conference contribution.","{'MEANINGFUL_COMPARISON': 2, 'ORIGINALITY': 4, 'CLARITY': 5}"

I like the model architecture since it has two clear improvements over traditional approaches — (1) the information flows in two directions, both from the parent and from siblings, which is desirable in tree structures (2) the model use a probability distribution to model the tree boundary (i.e. the last sibling or the leaf). This avoids the use of special ending symbols which is larger in size and putting more things to learn for the parameters (shared with other symbols).

The authors test the DRNN using the tasks of recovering the synthetic trees and recovering functional programs. The model did better than traditional methods like seq2seq models.

I think the recovering synthetic tree task is not very satisfying for two reasons — (1) the surface form itself already containing some of the topological information which makes the task easier than it should be (2) as we can see from figure 3, when the number of nodes grows (even to a number not very large), the performance of the model drops dramatically, I am not sure if a simple baseline only captures the topological information in the surface string would be much worse than this. And DRNN in this case, seems can’t show its full potentials since the length of the information flow in the model won’t be very long.

I think the experiments are interesting. But I think there are some other tasks which are more difficult and the tree structure information are more important in such tasks. For example, we have the seq2seq parsing model (Vinyals et al, 2014), is it possible to use the DRNN proposed here on the decoder side? I think tasks like this can show more potentials of the DRNN and can be very convincing that model architectures like this are better than traditional alternatives.","{'IMPACT': 1, 'MEANINGFUL_COMPARISON': 1, 'ORIGINALITY': 2, 'CLARITY': 2}"
