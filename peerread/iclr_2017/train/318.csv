Learning Graphical State Transitions,"Graph-structured data is important in modeling relationships between multiple entities, and can be used to represent states of the world as well as many data structures. Li et al. (2016) describe a model known as a Gated Graph Sequence Neural Network (GGS-NN) that produces sequences from graph-structured input. In this work I introduce the Gated Graph Transformer Neural Network (GGT-NN), an extension of GGS-NNs that uses graph-structured data as an intermediate representation. The model can learn to construct and modify graphs in sophisticated ways based on textual input, and also to use the graphs to produce a variety of outputs. For example, the model successfully learns to solve almost all of the bAbI tasks (Weston et al., 2016), and also discovers the rules governing graphical formulations of a simple cellular automaton and a family of Turing machines.","This paper proposes learning on the fly to represent a dialog as a graph (which acts as the memory), and is first demonstrated on the bAbI tasks. Graph learning is part of the inference process, though there is long term representation learning to learn graph transformation parameters and the encoding of sentences as input to the graph. This seems to be the first implementation of a differentiable memory as graph: it is much more complex than previous approaches like memory networks without significant gain in performance in bAbI tasks, but it is still very preliminary work, and the representation of memory as a graph seems much more powerful than a stack. Clarity is a major issue, but from an initial version that was constructive and better read by a computer than a human, the author proposed a hugely improved later version. This original, technically accurate (within what I understood) and thought provoking paper is worth publishing.

The preliminary results do not tell us yet if the highly complex graph-based differentiable memory has more learning or generalization capacity than other approaches. The performance on the bAbI task is comparable to the best memory networks, but still worse than more traditional rule induction (see ","{'IMPACT': 4, 'SUBSTANCE': 3, 'MEANINGFUL_COMPARISON': 3, 'SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS': 3, 'CLARITY': 5}"
