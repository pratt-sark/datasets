Learning Invariant Feature Spaces to Transfer Skills with Reinforcement Learning,"People can learn a wide range of tasks from their own experience, but can also learn from observing other creatures. This can accelerate acquisition of new skills even when the observed agent differs substantially from the learning agent in terms of morphology. In this paper, we examine how reinforcement learning algorithms can transfer knowledge between morphologically different agents (e.g., different robots). We introduce a problem formulation where twp agents are tasked with learning multiple skills by sharing information. Our method uses the skills that were learned by both agents to train invariant feature spaces that can then be used to transfer other skills from one agent to another. The process of learning these invariant feature spaces can be viewed as a kind of ``analogy making,'' or implicit learning of partial correspondences between two distinct domains. We evaluate our transfer learning algorithm in two simulated robotic manipulation skills, and illustrate that we can transfer knowledge between simulated robotic arms with different numbers of links, as well as simulated arms with different actuation mechanisms, where one robot is torque-driven while the other is tendon-driven.","
This paper explores transfer in reinforcement learning between agents that may be morphologically distinct. The key idea is for the source and target agent to have learned a shared skill, and then to use this to construct abstract feature spaces to enable the transfer of a new unshared skill in the source agent to the target agent. The paper is related to much other work on transfer that uses shared latent spaces, such as CCA and its variants, including manifold alignment and kernel CCA. 


The paper reports on experiments using a simple physics simulator between robot arms consisting of three vs. four links. For comparison, a simple CCA based approach is shown, although it would have been preferable to see comparisons for something more current and up to date, such as manifold alignment or kernel CCA. A three layer neural net is used to construct the latent feature spaces. 

The problem of transfer in RL is extremely important, and receives less attention than it should. This work uses an interesting hypothesis of trying to construct transfer based on shared skills between source and target agent. This is a promising approach. However, the comparisons to related approaches is not very up to date, and the domains are fairly simplistic. There is little by way of theoretical development of the ideas using MDP theory.

A core component of the proposed approach is to use a task-invariant future space, which can be shared between tasks & between agents.

Compared to previous work (Ammar et al. 2015), it seems the main contribution here is to “assume that good correspondences in episodic tasks can be extracted through time alignment” (Sec. 2).  This is an interesting hypothesis. There is also similarity to work by Raimalwala et al (2016), but the authors argue their method is better equipped to handle non-linear dynamics. These are two interesting hypotheses, however I don’t see that they have been verified in the presented empirical results.  In particular, the question of the pairing correspondence seems crucial. What happens when the time alignment is not suitable. Is it possible to use dynamic time warping (or similar method) to achieve reasonable results?  Robustness to misspecification of the pairing correspondence P seems a major concern.

In general, more comparison to other transfer methods, including those listed in Sec.2, would be very valuable.  The addition of Sec.5.1 is definitely a right step in this direction, but represents a small portion of the recent work on transfer learning.  I appreciate that other methods transfer other pieces of information (e.g. the policy), but still if the end goal is better performance, what is worth transferring (in addition to how to do the transfer) should be a reasonable question to explore.

Overall, the paper tackles an important problem, but this is a very active area of research, and further comparison to other methods would be worthwhile.  The method proposed of transferring the representation is well motivated, cleanly described, and conceptually sound.  The assumption that time alignment can be used for the state pairing seems problematic, and should be further validated.","{'IMPACT': 4, 'SUBSTANCE': 3, 'SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS': 3, 'ORIGINALITY': 4}"
