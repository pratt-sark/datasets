Improving Neural Language Models with a Continuous Cache,"We propose an extension to neural network language models to adapt their prediction to the recent history. Our model is a simplified version of memory augmented networks, which stores past hidden activations as memory and accesses them through a dot product with the current hidden activation. This mechanism is very efficient and scales to very large memory sizes. We also draw a link between the use of external memory in neural network and cache models used with count based language models. We demonstrate on several language model datasets that our approach performs significantly better than recent memory augmented networks.","The authors present a simple method to affix a cache to neural language models, which provides in effect a copying mechanism from recently used words. Unlike much related work in neural networks with copying mechanisms, this mechanism need not be trained with long-term backpropagation, which makes it efficient and scalable to much larger cache sizes. They demonstrate good improvements on language modeling by adding this cache to RNN baselines.

The main contribution of this paper is the observation that simply using the hidden states h_i as keys for words x_i, and h_t as the query vector, naturally gives a lookup mechanism that works fine without tuning by backprop. This is a simple observation and might already exist as folk knowledge among some people, but it has nice implications for scalability and the experiments are convincing.

The basic idea of repurposing locally-learned representations for large-scale attention where backprop would normally be prohibitively expensive is an interesting one, and could probably be used to improve other types of memory networks.

My main criticism of this work is its simplicity and incrementality when compared to previously existing literature. As a simple modification of existing NLP models, but with good empirical success, simplicity and practicality, it is probably more suitable for an NLP-specific conference. However, I think that approaches that distill recent work into a simple, efficient, applicable form should be rewarded and that this tool will be useful to a large enough portion of the ICLR community to recommend its publication.","{'ORIGINALITY': 2, 'CLARITY': 5}"

Regardless of whether this is due to the small BPTT window (35 is standard) or an issue with the capability of the RNN itself, this is a useful insight. This technique is an interesting variation of memory augmented neural networks with a number of advantages to many of the standard memory augmented architectures.

They illustrate the neural cache model on not just the Penn Treebank but also WikiText-2 and WikiText-103, two datasets specifically tailored to illustrating long term dependencies with a more realistic vocabulary size. I have not seen the ability to refer up to 2000 words back previously.
I recommend this paper be accepted. There is additionally extensive analysis of the hyperparameters on these datasets, providing further insight.

I recommend this interesting and well analyzed paper be accepted.",{'SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS': 4}
