Lossy Image Compression with Compressive Autoencoders,"We propose a new approach to the problem of optimizing autoencoders for lossy image compression. New media formats, changing hardware technology, as well as diverse requirements and content types create a need for compression algorithms which are more flexible than existing codecs. Autoencoders have the potential to address this need, but are difficult to optimize directly due to the inherent non-differentiabilty of the compression loss. We here show that minimal changes to the loss are sufficient to train deep autoencoders competitive with JPEG 2000 and outperforming recently proposed approaches based on RNNs. Our network is furthermore computationally efficient thanks to a sub-pixel architecture, which makes it suitable for high-resolution images. This is in contrast to previous work on autoencoders for compression using coarser approximations, shallower architectures, computationally expensive methods, or focusing on small images.","This paper proposes an autoencoder approach to lossy image compression by minimizing the weighted sum of reconstruction error and code length. The architecture consists of a convolutional encoder and a sub-pixel convolutional decoder. Experiments compare PSNR, SSIM, and MS-SSIM performance against JPEG, JPEG-2000, and a recent RNN-based compression approach. A mean opinion score test was also conducted.

Pros:
+ The paper is clear and well-written.
+ The decoder architecture takes advantage of recent advances in convolutional approaches to image super-resolution.
+ The proposed approaches to quantization and rate estimation are sensible and well-justified.

Cons:
- The experimental baselines do not appear to be entirely complete.

The task of using autoencoders to perform compression is important and has a large practical impact. Though directly optimizing the rate-distortion tradeoff is not an entirely novel enterprise, there are enough differences (e.g. the quantization approach and sub-pixel convolutional decoder) to sufficiently distinguish this from earlier work. I am not an image compression expert but the approach and results both seem compelling. The main shortcoming is that the implementation of Toderici et al. 2016b appears to be incomplete, and there is no comparison to Balle et al. 2016. Overall, I feel that the fact that this architecture achieves competitive performance with JPEG-2000 while simultaneously setting the stage for future work that varies the encoder/decoder size and data domain means the community will find this work to be of significant interest.

I have no further specific comments at this time as they were answered sufficiently in the pre-review questions.","{'IMPACT': 3, 'SUBSTANCE': 4, 'SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS': 4, 'CLARITY': 4}"

While the idea is certainly interesting and well-motivated, in practice, it turns out to achieve effectively identical rates to JPEG-2000.

Now, as the authors argue, there is some value to the fact that this scheme was learned automatically rather than by expert design---which means it has benefits beyond the compression of natural images (e.g., it could be used to automatically learning a compression scheme for signals for which we don't have as much domain knowledge). However, I still believe that this makes the paper unsuitable for publication in its current form because of the following reasons---

1. Firstly, the fact that the learned encoder is competitive---and not clearly better---than JPEG 2000 means that the focus of the paper should more be about the aspects in which the encoder is similar to, and the aspects in which it differs, from JPEG 2000. Is it learning similar filters or completely different ones ? For what kinds of textures does it do better and for what kinds does it do worse (the paper could show the best and worst 10 patches at different bit-rates) ?

2. Secondly, I think it's crucial that the paper demonstrate that the benefits come from a better coding scheme (as opposed to just a better decoder), as suggested in my initial pre-review question. How would a decoder trained on JPEG-2000 codes (and perhaps also on encoded random projections) do worse or better ?

3. Finally, I think the fact that it does as well/worse than JPEG-2000 significantly diminishes the case for using a 'deep' auto-encoder. JPEG-2000 essentially uses a wavelet transform, which is a basis that past studies have shown could be recovered using a simple sparse dictionary algorithm like K-SVD. This is why I feel that the method needs to clearly outperform JPEG-2000, or show comparisons to (or atleast discuss) a well-crafted traditional/generative model-based baseline.",{'SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS': 5}
