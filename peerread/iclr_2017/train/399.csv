 Outrageously Large Neural Networks: The Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts Layer,"The capacity of a neural network to absorb information is limited by its number of parameters.  Conditional computation, where parts of the network are active on a per-example basis, has been proposed in theory as a way of dramatically increasing model capacity without a proportional increase in computation.  In practice, however, there are significant algorithmic and performance challenges.  In this work, we address these challenges and finally realize the promise of conditional computation, achieving greater than 1000x improvements in model capacity with only minor losses in computational efficiency on modern GPU clusters.  We introduce a Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts layer (MoE), consisting of up to thousands of feed-forward sub-networks.  A trainable gating network determines a sparse combination of these experts to use for each example.  We apply the MoE to the tasks of language modeling and machine translation, where model capacity is critical for absorbing the vast quantities of knowledge available in the training corpora.  We present model architectures in which a MoE with up to 137 billion parameters is applied convolutionally between stacked LSTM layers.  On large language modeling and machine translation benchmarks, these models achieve significantly better results than state-of-the-art at lower computational cost.","This paper describes a method for greatly expanding network model size (in terms of number of stored parameters) in the context of a recurrent net, by applying a Mixture of Experts between recurrent net layers that is shared between all time steps.  By process features from all timesteps at the same time, the effective batch size to the MoE is increased by a factor of the number of steps in the model; thus even for sparsely assigned experts, each expert can be used on a large enough sub-batch of inputs to remain computationally efficient.  Another second technique that redistributes elements within a distributed model is also described, further increasing per-expert batch sizes.

Experiments are performed on language modeling and machine translation tasks, showing significant gains by increasing the number of experts, compared to both SoA as well as explicitly computationally-matched baseline systems.

An area that falls a bit short is in presenting plots or statistics on the real computational load and system behavior.  While two loss terms were employed to balance the use of experts, these are not explored in the experiments section.  It would have been nice to see the effects of these more, along with the effects of increasing effective batch sizes, e.g. measurements of the losses over the course of training, compared to the counts/histogram distributions of per-expert batch sizes.

Overall I think this is a well-described system that achieves good results, using a nifty placement for the MoE that can overcome what otherwise might be a disadvantage for sparse computation.



Small comment:
I like Fig 3, but it's not entirely clear whether datapoints coincide between left and right plots.  The H-H line has 3 points on left but 5 on the right?  Also would be nice if the colors matched between corresponding lines.","{'IMPACT': 5, 'SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS': 4}"
