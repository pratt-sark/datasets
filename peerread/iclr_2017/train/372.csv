Learning to Remember Rare Events,"Despite recent advances, memory-augmented deep neural networks are still limited when it comes to life-long and one-shot learning, especially in remembering rare events. We present a large-scale life-long memory module for use in deep learning. The module exploits fast nearest-neighbor algorithms for efficiency and thus scales to large memory sizes. Except for the nearest-neighbor query, the module is fully differentiable and trained end-to-end with no extra supervision.  It operates in a life-long manner, i.e., without the need to reset it during training.  Our memory module can be easily added to any part of a supervised neural network. To show its versatility we add it to a number of networks, from simple convolutional ones tested on image classification to deep sequence-to-sequence and recurrent-convolutional models. In all cases, the enhanced network gains the ability to remember and do life-long one-shot learning. Our module remembers training examples shown many thousands of steps in the past and it can successfully generalize from them. We set new state-of-the-art for one-shot learning on the Omniglot dataset and demonstrate, for the first time, life-long one-shot learning in recurrent neural networks on a large-scale machine translation task.","This paper proposes a new memory module for large scale life-long and one-shot learning. The module is general enough that the authors apply the module to several neural network architectures and show improvements in performance.

Using k-nearest neighbors for memory access is not completely new. This has been recently explored in Rae et al., 2016 and Chandar et al., 2016. K-nearest neighbors based memory for one-shot learning has also been explored in [R1]. This paper provides experimental evidence that such an approach can be applied to a variety of architectures.

Authors have addressed all my pre-review questions and I am ok with their response.

Are the authors willing to release the source code to reproduce the results? At least for omniglot experiments and synthetic task experiments?

Pros:
* Clearly written and original idea.
* Useful memory module, shows nice improvements.
* Tested on some big tasks.

Cons:
* No comparisons to other memory modules such as associative LSTMs etc.
