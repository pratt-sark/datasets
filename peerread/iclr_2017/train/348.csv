Steerable CNNs,"It has long been recognized that the invariance and equivariance properties of a representation are critically important for success in many vision tasks. In this paper we present Steerable Convolutional Neural Networks, an efficient and flexible class of equivariant convolutional networks. We show that steerable CNNs achieve state of the art results on the CIFAR image classification benchmark. The mathematical theory of steerable representations reveals a type system in which any steerable representation is a composition of elementary feature types, each one associated with a particular kind of symmetry. We show how the parameter cost of a steerable filter bank depends on the types of the input and output features, and show how to use this knowledge to construct CNNs that utilize parameters effectively.","The authors propose a parameterization of CNNs that guarantees equivariance wrt a large family of geometric transformations.

The mathematical analysis is rigorous and the material is very interesting and novel. The paper overall reads well; there is a real effort to explain the math accessibly, though some small improvements could be made.

The theory is general enough to include continuous transformations, although the experiments are restricted to discrete ones. While this could be seen as a negative point, it is justified by the experiments, which show that this set of transformations is powerful enough to yield very good results on CIFAR.

Another form of intertwiner has been studied recently by Lenc & Vedaldi [1]; they have studied equivariance empirically in CNNs, which offers an orthogonal view.

In addition to the recent references on scale/rotation deep networks suggested below, geometric equivariance has been studied extensively in the 2000's; mentioning at least one work would be appropriate. The one that probably comes closest to the proposed method is the work by Reisert [2], who studied steerable filters for invariance and equivariance, using Lie group theory. The difference, of course, is that the focus at the time was on kernel machines rather than CNNs, but many of the tools and theorems are relatable.


Some of the notation could be simplified, to make the formulas easier to grasp on a first read:

Working over a lattice Z^d is unnecessarily abstract -- since the inputs are always images, Z^2 would make much of the later math easier to parse. Generalization is straightforward, so I don't think the results lose anything by it; and the authors go back to 2D latices later anyway.

It could be more natural to do away with the layer index l which appears throughout the paper, and have notation for current/next layer instead (e.g. pi and pi'; K and D instead of K_{l+1} and K_l).

In any case I leave it up to the authors to decide whether to include these suggestions on notation, but I urge them to consider them (or other ways to unburden notation).


A few minor issues: Some statements would be better supported with an accompanying reference (e.g. ""Explicit formulas exist"" on page 5, the introduction of intertwiners on page 3). Finally, there is a tiny mistake in the Balduzzi & Ghifary reference (some extra information was included as an author name).

The mathematical motivations/derivations of the proposed architecture are detailed and rigorous. The proposed architecture promises to produce equivariant representations with steerable features using fewer parameters than traditional CNNs, which is particularly useful in small data regimes. Interesting and novel connections are presented between steerable filters and so called “steerable fibers”. The architecture is strongly inspired by the author’s previous work, as well as that of “capsules” (Hinton, 2011). The proposed architecture is compared on CIFAR10 against state-of-the-art inspired architectures (ResNets), and is shown to be superior particularly in the small data regime. The lack of empirical comparison on large scale dataset, such as ImageNet or COCO makes this largely a theoretical contribution. I would have also liked to see more empirical evaluation of the equivariance properties. It is not intuitively clear exactly why this architecture performs better on CIFAR10 as it is not clear that capturing equivariances helps to classify different instances of object categories. Wouldn’t action-recognition in videos, for example, not be a better illustrative dataset?
