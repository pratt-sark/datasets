Improving Generative Adversarial Networks with Denoising Feature Matching,"We propose an augmented training procedure for generative adversarial networks designed to address shortcomings of the original by directing the generator towards probable configurations of abstract discriminator features. We estimate and track the distribution of these features, as computed from data, with a denoising auto-encoder, and use it to propose high-level targets for the generator. We combine this new loss with the original and evaluate the hybrid criterion on the task of unsupervised image synthesis from datasets comprising a diverse set of visual categories, noting a qualitative and quantitative improvement in the ``objectness'' of the resulting samples.","This paper is well written, and well presented. This method is using denoise autoencoder to learn an implicit probability distribution helps reduce training difficulty, which is neat. In my view, joint training with an auto-encoder is providing extra auxiliary gradient information to improve generator. Providing auxiliary information may be a methodology to improve GAN.

In particular, the features as determined by the discriminator, of images generated by the generator, are fed into a denoising AE and we try to have these be reconstructed well. I think it's an interesting idea to use this ""extra information"" -- namely the feature representations learned by the discriminator. It seems very much in the spirit of ICLR! My main concern, though, is that I'm not wholly convinced on the nature of the improvement. This method achieves higher inception scores than other methods in some cases, but I have a hard time interpreting these scores and thus a hard time getting excited by the results. In particular, the authors have not convinced me that the benefits outweigh the required additional sophistication both conceptually and implementation-wise (speaking of which, will code be released?). One thing I'd be curious to know is, how hard is it to get this thing to actually work? 

Also, I view GANs as a means to an end -- while I'm not particularly excited about generating realistic images (especially in 32x32), I'm very excited about the future potential of GAN-based systems. So it would have been nice to see these improvements in inception score translate into improvements in a more useful task. But this criticism could probably apply to many GAN papers and so perhaps isn't fair here. 

I do think the idea of exploiting ""extra information"" (like discriminator features) is interesting both inside and outside the context of this paper. ",{'SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS': 3}

The use of denoising autoencoders is motivated by the observation that they implicitly capture the distribution of the data they were trained on. While sampling methods based denoising autoencoders alone don't amount to very interesting generative models (at least no-one could demonstrate otherwise), this paper shows that it can be combined successfully with generative adversarial networks.

My overall assessment of this paper is that it is well written, well reasoned, and presents a good idea motivated from first principles. I feel that the idea presented here is not revolutionary or a very radical departure from what has been done before, I would have liked a slightly more structured experiments section which focusses on and provides insights into the relative merits of different choices one could make (see pre-review questions for details), rather than focussing just on demonstrating that a chosen variant works.

In addition to this general review, I have already posted specific questions and criticism in the pre-review questions - thanks for the authors' responses. Based on those responses the area I am most uncomfortable about is whether the (Alain & Bengio, 2014) intuition about the denoising autoencoders is valid if it all happens in a nonlinear featurespace. If the denoiser function's behaviour ends up depending on the Jacobian of the nonlinear transformation Phi, another question is whether this dependence is exploitable by the optimization scheme.","{'SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS': 5, 'CLARITY': 3}"
