Words or Characters? Fine-grained Gating for Reading Comprehension,"Previous work combines word-level and character-level representations using concatenation or scalar weighting, which is suboptimal for high-level tasks like reading comprehension. We present a fine-grained gating mechanism to dynamically combine word-level and character-level representations based on properties of the words. We also extend the idea of fine-grained gating to modeling the interaction between questions and paragraphs for reading comprehension. Experiments show that our approach can improve the performance on reading comprehension tasks, achieving new state-of-the-art results on the Children's Book Test and Who Did What datasets. To demonstrate the generality of our gating mechanism, we also show improved results on a social media tag prediction task.","This paper proposes a new gating mechanism to combine word and character representations. The proposed model sets a new state-of-the-art on the CBT dataset; the new gating mechanism also improves over scalar gates without linguistic features on SQuAD and a twitter classification task. 

Intuitively, the vector-based gate working better than the scalar gate is unsurprising, as it is more similar to LSTM and GRU gates. The real contribution of the paper for me is that using features such as POS tags and NER help learn better gates. The visualization in Figure 3 and examples in Table 4 effectively confirm the utility of these features, very nice! 

In sum, while the proposed gate is nothing technically groundbreaking, the paper presents a very focused contribution that I think will be useful to the NLP community. Thus, I hope it is accepted.","{'SUBSTANCE': 4, 'CLARITY': 3}"

I like the fact that the authors use POS and NER in terms of an intermediate signal for the decision. Also they compare against a sufficient range of baselines to show the effectiveness of the proposed model.

I am also convinced by the authors' answers to my question, I think there is sufficient evidence provided in the results to show the effectiveness of the inductive bias introduced by the fine-grained gating model.","{'IMPACT': 3, 'SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS': 5, 'CLARITY': 4}"
