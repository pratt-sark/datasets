Trained Ternary Quantization,"Deep neural networks are widely used in machine learning applications. However, the deployment of large neural networks models can be difficult to deploy on mobile devices with limited power budgets. To solve this problem, we propose Trained Ternary Quantization (TTQ), a method that can reduce the precision of weights in neural networks to ternary values. This method has very little accuracy degradation and can even improve the accuracy of some models (32, 44, 56-layer ResNet) on CIFAR-10 and AlexNet on ImageNet. And our AlexNet model is trained from scratch, which means it’s as easy as to train normal full precision model. We highlight our trained quantization method that can learn both ternary values and ternary assignment. During inference, only ternary values (2-bit weights) and scaling factors are needed, therefore our models are nearly 16× smaller than full- precision models. Our ternary models can also be viewed as sparse binary weight networks, which can potentially be accelerated with custom circuit. Experiments on CIFAR-10 show that the ternary models obtained by trained quantization method outperform full-precision models of ResNet-32,44,56 by 0.04%, 0.16%, 0.36%, respectively. On ImageNet, our model outperforms full-precision AlexNet model by 0.3% of Top-1 accuracy and outperforms previous ternary models by 3%.","This work presents a novel ternary weight quantization approach which quantizes weights to either 0 or one of two layer specific learned values. Unlike past work, these quantized values are separate and learned stochastically alongside all other network parameters. This approach achieves impressive quantization results while retaining or surpassing corresponding full-precision networks on CIFAR10 and ImageNet.

Strengths:

- Overall well written and algorithm is presented clearly.
- Approach appears to work well in the experiments, resulting in good compression without loss (and sometimes gain!) of performance.
- I enjoyed the analysis of sparsity (and how it changes) over the course of training, though it is uncertain if any useful conclusion can be drawn from it.

Some points:

- The energy analysis in Table 3 assumes dense activations due to the unpredictability of sparse activations. Can the authors provide average activation sparsity for each network to help verify this assumption. Even if the assumption does not hold, relatively close values for average activation between the networks would make the comparison more convincing.

- In section 5.1.1, the authors suggest having a fixed t (threshold parameter set at 0.05) for all layers allows for varying sparsity (owed to the relative magnitude of different layer weights with respect to the maximum). In Section 5.1.2 paragraph 2, this is further developed by suggesting additional sparsity can be achieved by allowing each layer a different values of t. How are these values set? Does this multiple threshold style network appear in any of the tables or figures? Can it be added?

- The authors claim ""ii) Quantized weights play the role of ""learning rate multipliers"" during back propagation."" as a benefit of using trained quantization factors. Why is this a benefit? 

- Figure and table captions are not very descriptive.

Preliminary Rating:
I think this is an interesting paper with convincing results but is somewhat lacking in novelty. 

Minor notes:
- Table 3 lists FLOPS rather than Energy for the full precision model. Why?
- Section 5 'speeding up'
- 5.1.1 figure reference error last line

It goes on to provide an exhaustive analysis of performance (essentially no loss) on real benchmarks (this paper is remarkably MNIST-free).

The relevance of this paper is that it likely provides a lower bound on quantization approaches that don't sacrifice any performance, and hence can plausibly become the approach of choice for resource-constrained inference, and might suggest new hardware designs to take advantage of the proposed structure.

Furthermore, the paper provides power measurements, which is really the main metric that anyone working seriously in that space cares about. (Nit: I don't see measurements for the full-precision baseline).

I would have loved to see a SOTA result on ImageNet and a result on a strong LSTM baseline to be fully convinced.
I would have also liked to see discussion of the wall time to result using this training procedure.","{'SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS': 3, 'ORIGINALITY': 3}"
