Pruning Filters for Efficient ConvNets,"The success of CNNs in various applications is accompanied by a significant increase in the computation and parameter storage costs. Recent efforts toward reducing these overheads involve pruning and compressing the weights of various layers without hurting original accuracy.  However, magnitude-based pruning of weights reduces a significant number of parameters from the fully connected layers and may not adequately reduce the computation costs in the convolutional layers due to irregular sparsity in the pruned networks. We present an acceleration method for CNNs, where we prune filters from CNNs that are identified as having a small effect on the output accuracy. By removing whole filters in the network together with their connecting feature maps, the computation costs are reduced significantly. In contrast to pruning weights, this approach does not result in sparse connectivity patterns. Hence, it does not need the support of sparse convolution libraries and can work with existing efficient BLAS libraries for dense matrix multiplications. We show that even simple filter pruning techniques can reduce inference costs for VGG-16 by up to 34% and ResNet-110 by up to 38% on CIFAR10 while regaining close to the original accuracy by retraining the networks.","This paper prunes entire groups of filters in CNN so that they reduce computational cost and at the same time do not result in sparse connectivity. This result is important to speed up and compress neural networks while being able to use standard fully-connected linear algebra routines. 
The results are a 10% improvements in ResNet-like and ImageNet, which may be also achieved with better design of networks. New networks should have been also compared, but this we know it is time-consuming.
A good paper with some useful results.",{'IMPACT': 3}

Pros:
- Impressively retains accuracy on popular models on ImageNet and Cifar10

Cons:
- There is no justification for for low L1 or L2 norm being a good selection criteria. There are two easy critical missing baselines of 1) randomly pruning filters, 2) pruning filters with low activation pattern norms on training set.
- There is no direct comparison to the multitude of other pruning and speedup methods.
- While FLOPs are reported, it is not clear what empirical speedup this method gives, which is what people interested in these methods care about. Wall-clock speedup is trivial to report, so the lack of wall-clock speedup is suspect.

The proposed method is experimented on with VGG-16 and ResNets on CIFAR10 and ImageNet.

Pros:
- Creates *structured* sparsity, which automatically improves performance without changing the underlying convolution implementation
- Very simple to implement

Cons:
- No evaluation of how pruning impacts transfer learning

I'm generally positive about this work. While the main idea is almost trivial, I am not aware of any other papers that propose exactly the same idea and show a good set of experimental results. Therefore I'm inclined to accept it. The only major downside is that the paper does not evaluate the impact of filter pruning on transfer learning. For example, there is not much interest in the tasks of CIFAR10 or even ImageNet. Instead, the main interest in both academia and industry is the value of the learned representation for transferring to other tasks. One might expect filter pruning (or any other kind of pruning) to harm transfer learning. It's possible that the while the main task has about the same performance, transfer learning is strongly hurt. This paper has missed an opportunity to explore that direction.
