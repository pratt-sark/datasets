"Attend, Adapt and Transfer: Attentive Deep Architecture for Adaptive Transfer from multiple sources in the same domain","Transferring knowledge from prior source tasks in solving a new target task can be useful in several learning applications. The application of transfer poses two serious challenges which have not been adequately addressed. First, the agent should be able to avoid negative transfer, which happens when the transfer hampers or slows down the learning instead of helping it. Second, the agent should be able to selectively transfer, which is the ability to select and transfer from different and multiple source tasks for different parts of the state space of the target task. We propose A2T (Attend Adapt and Transfer), an attentive deep architecture which adapts and transfers from these source tasks. Our model is generic enough to effect transfer of either policies or value functions. Empirical evaluations on different learning algorithms show that A2T is an effective architecture for transfer by being able to avoid negative transfer while transferring selectively from multiple source tasks in the same domain.","This paper studies the problem of transferring solutions of existing tasks to tackle a novel task under the framework of reinforcement learning and identifies two important issues of avoiding negative transfer and being selective transfer. The proposed approach is based on a convex combination of existing solutions and the being-learned solution to the novel task. The non-negative weight of each solution implies that the solution of negative effect is ignored and more weights are allocated to more relevant solution in each state. This paper derives this so-called ""A2T"" learning algorithm for policy transfer and value transfer for REINFORCE and ACTOR-CRITIC algorithms and experiments with synthetic Chain World and Puddle World simulation and Atari 2600 game Pong. 
+This paper presents a novel approach for transfer reinforcement learning.
+The experiments are cleverly designed to demonstrate the ability of the proposed method.
-An important aspect of transfer learning is that the algorithm can automatically figure out if the existing solutions to known tasks are sufficient to solve the novel task so that it can save the time and energy of learning-from-scratch. This issue is not studied in this paper as most of experiments have a learning-from-scratch solution as base network. It will be interesting to see how well the algorithm performs without base network. In addition, from Figure 3, 5 and 6, the proposed algorithm seems to accelerate the learning speed, but the overall network seems not better than the solo base network. It will be more convincing to show some example that existing solutions are complementary to the base network.
-If ignoring the base network, the proposed network can be considered as ensemble reinforcement learning that take advantages of learned agents with different expertise to solve the novel task. ","{'IMPACT': 5, 'ORIGINALITY': 2}"
