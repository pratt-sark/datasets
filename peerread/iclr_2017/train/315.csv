On Large-Batch Training for Deep Learning: Generalization Gap and Sharp Minima,"The stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method and its variants are algorithms of choice for many Deep Learning tasks. These methods operate in a small-batch regime wherein a fraction of the training data,  say $32$--$512$ data points, is sampled to compute an approximation to the gradient. It has been observed in practice that when using a larger batch there is a  degradation in the quality of the model, as measured by its ability to generalize. We investigate the cause for this generalization drop in the large-batch regime and present numerical evidence that supports the view that large-batch methods tend to converge to sharp minimizers of the training and testing functions---and as is well known, sharp minima lead to poorer generalization. In contrast, small-batch methods consistently converge to flat minimizers, and our experiments support a commonly held view that this is due to the inherent noise in the gradient estimation. We  discuss several  strategies to attempt to help large-batch methods eliminate this generalization gap.","Interesting paper, definitely provides value to the community by discussing why large batch gradient descent does not work too well","{'IMPACT': 4, 'CLARITY': 4}"

SGD with smaller batch sizes converges to flatter minima, 2. flatter minima have better generalization ability. 

Pros and Cons:
Although there is little novelty in the paper, I think the work is of great value in shedding light into some interesting questions around generalization of deep networks. 

Significance:
I think such results may have impact on both theory and practice, respectively by suggesting what assumptions are legitimate for real scenarios for building new theories, or be used heuristically to develop new algorithms with generalization by smart manipulation of mini-batch sizes.

Comments:
Earlier I had some concern about the correctness of a claim made by the authors, which is resolved now. They had claimed their proposed sharpness criterion is scale invariance. They took care of it by removing this claim in the revised version.
