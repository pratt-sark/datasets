Third Person Imitation Learning,"Reinforcement learning (RL) makes it possible to train agents capable of achieving sophisticated goals in complex and uncertain environments. A key difficulty in reinforcement learning is specifying a reward function for the agent to optimize. Traditionally, imitation learning in RL has been used to overcome this problem. Unfortunately, hitherto imitation learning methods tend to require that demonstrations are supplied in the first-person: the agent is provided with a sequence of states and a specification of the actions that it should have taken. While powerful, this kind of imitation learning is limited by the relatively hard problem of collecting first-person demonstrations. Humans address this problem by learning from third-person demonstrations: they observe other humans perform tasks, infer the task, and accomplish the same task themselves. In this paper, we present a method for unsupervised third-person imitation learning. Here third-person refers to training an agent to correctly achieve a simple goal in a simple environment when it is provided a demonstration of a teacher achieving the same goal but from a different viewpoint; and unsupervised refers to the fact that the agent receives only these third-person demonstrations, and is not provided a correspondence between teacher states and student states. Our methods primary insight is that recent advances from domain confusion can be utilized to yield domain agnostic features which are crucial during the training process. To validate our approach, we report successful experiments on learning from third-person demonstrations in a pointmass domain, a reacher domain, and inverted pendulum.","This paper proposed a novel adversarial framework to train a model from demonstrations in a third-person perspective, to perform the task in the first-person view. Here the adversarial training is used to extract a novice-expert (or third-person/first-person) independent feature so that the agent can use to perform the same policy in a different view point.

While the idea is quite elegant and novel (I enjoy reading it), more experiments are needed to justify the approach. Probably the most important issue is that there is no baseline, e.g., what if we train the model with the image from the same viewpoint? It should be better than the proposed approach but how close are they? How the performance changes when we gradually change the viewpoint from third-person to first-person? Another important question is that maybe the network just blindly remembers the policy, in this case, the extracted feature could be artifacts of the input image that implicitly counts the time tick in some way (and thus domain-agonistic), but can still perform reasonable policy. Since the experiments are conduct in a synthetic environment, this might happen. An easy check is to run the algorithm on multiple viewpoint and/or with blurred/differently rendered images, and/or with random initial conditions.

Other ablation analysis is also needed. For example, I am not fully convinced by the gradient flipping trick used in Eqn. 5, and in the experiments there is no ablation analysis for that (GAN/EM style training versus gradient flipping trick). For the experiments, Fig. 4,5,6 does not have error bars and is not very convincing.","{'SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS': 4, 'CLARITY': 5}"

This is an important contribution, with several good applications.  The main insight is to use adversarial training to learn a policy that is robust to this difference in perspective.  This problem formulation is quite novel compared to the standard imitation learning literature (usually first-order perspective), though has close links to the literature on transfer learning (as explained in Sec.2).

The basic approach is clearly explained, and follows quite readily from recent literature on imitation learning and adversarial training.

I would have expected to see comparison to the following methods added to Figure 3:
1)  Standard 1st person imitation learning using agent A data, and apply the policy on agent A.  This is an upper-bound on how well you can expect to do, since you have the correct perspective.
2)  Standard 1st person imitation learning using agent A data, then apply the policy on agent B.  Here, I expect it might do less well than 3rd person learning, but worth checking to be sure, and showing what is the gap in performance.
3)  Reinforcement learning using agent A data, and apply the policy on agent A.  I expect this might do better than 3rd person imitation learning but it might depend on the scenario (e.g. difficulty of imitation vs exploration; how different are the points of view between the agents). I understand this is how the expert data is collected for the demonstrator, but I don’t see the performance results from just using this procedure on the learner (to compare to Fig.3 results).

Including these results would in my view significantly enhance the impact of the paper.",{'ORIGINALITY': 1}
