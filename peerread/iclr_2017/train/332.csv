Transfer of View-manifold Learning to Similarity Perception of Novel Objects,"We develop a model of perceptual similarity judgment based on re-training a deep convolution neural network (DCNN) that learns to associate different views of each 3D object to capture the notion of object persistence and continuity in our visual experience. The re-training process effectively performs distance metric learning under the object persistency constraints, to modify the view-manifold of object representations. It reduces the effective distance between the representations of different views of the same object without compromising the distance between those of the views of different objects, resulting in the untangling of the view-manifolds between individual objects within the same category and across categories. This untangling enables the model to discriminate and recognize objects within the same category, independent of viewpoints. We found that this ability is not limited to the trained objects, but transfers to novel objects in both trained and untrained categories, as well as to a variety of completely novel artificial synthetic objects. This transfer in learning suggests the modification of distance metrics in view- manifolds is more general and abstract, likely at the levels of parts, and independent of the specific objects or categories experienced during training. Interestingly, the resulting transformation of feature representation in the deep networks is found to significantly better match human perceptual similarity judgment than AlexNet, suggesting that object persistence could be an important constraint in the development of perceptual similarity judgment in biological neural networks.","I think learning a deep feature representation that is supervised to group dissimilar views of the same object is interesting. The paper isn't technically especially novel but that doesn't bother me at all. It does a good job exploring a new form of supervision with a new dataset. I'm also not bothered that the dataset is synthetic, but it would be good to have more experiments with real data, as well. 

I think the paper goes too far in linking itself to human vision. I would prefer the intro not have as much cognitive science or neuroscience. The second to fourth paragraphs of the intro in particular feels like it over-stating the contribution of this paper as somehow revealing some truth about human vision. Really, the narrative is much simpler -- ""we often want deep feature representations that are viewpoint invariant. We supervise a deep network accordingly. Humans also have some capability to be viewpoint invariant which has been widely studied [citations]"". I am skeptical of any claimed connections bigger than that.

I think 3.1 should not be based on tree-to-tree distance comparisons but instead based on the entire matrix of instance-to-instance similarity assessments. Why do the lossy conversion to trees first? I don't think ""Remarkably"" is justified in the statement ""Remarkably, we found that OPnets similarity judgement matches a set of data on human similarity judgement, significantly better than AlexNet""

I'm not an expert on human vision, but from browsing online and from what I've learned before it seems that ""object persistence"" frequently relates to the concept of occlusion. Occlusion is never mentioned in this paper. I feel like the use of human vision terms might be misleading or overclaiming.
