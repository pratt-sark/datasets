Exploring Sparsity in Recurrent Neural Networks,"Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are widely used to solve a variety of problems and as the quantity of data and the amount of available compute have increased, so have model sizes. The number of parameters in recent state-of-the-art networks makes them hard to deploy, especially on mobile phones and embedded devices. The challenge is due to both the size of the model and the time it takes to evaluate it. In order to deploy these RNNs efficiently, we propose a technique to reduce the parameters of a network by pruning weights during the initial training of the network. At the end of training, the parameters of the network are sparse while accuracy is still close to the original dense neural network. The network size is reduced by 8× and the time required to train the model remains constant. Additionally, we can prune a larger dense network to achieve better than baseline performance while still reducing the total number of parameters significantly. Pruning RNNs reduces the size of the model and can also help achieve significant inference time speed-up using sparse GEMMs. Benchmarks show that using our technique model size can be reduced by 90% and speed-up is around 2× to 7×.","The paper proposes a method for pruning weights in neural networks during training to obtain sparse solutions. The approach is applied to an RNN-based system which is trained and evaluated on a speech recognition dataset. The results indicate that large savings in test-time computations can be obtained without affecting the task performance too much. In some cases the method can actually improve the evaluation performance.

The experiments are done using a state-of-the-art RNN system and the methodology of those experiments seems sound. I like that the effect of the pruning is investigated for networks of very large sizes. The computational gains are clearly substantial. It is a bit unfortunate that all experiments are done using a private dataset. Even with private training data, it would have been nice to see an evaluation on a known test set like the HUB5 for conversational speech. It would also have been nice to see a comparison with some other pruning approaches given the similarity of the proposed method to the work by Han et al. [2] to verify the relative merit of the proposed pruning scheme. While single-stage training looks more elegant at first sight, it may not save much time if more experiments are needed to find good hyperparameter settings for the threshold adaptation scheme. Finally, the dense baseline would have been more convincing if it involved some model compression tricks like training on the soft targets provided by a bigger network.

Overall, the paper is easy to read. The table and figure captions could be a bit more detailed but they are still clear enough. The discussion of potential future speed-ups of sparse recurrent neural networks and memory savings is interesting but not specific to the proposed pruning algorithm. The paper doesn’t motivate the details of the method very well. It’s not clear to me why the threshold has to ramp up after a certain period time for example. If this is based on preliminary findings, the paper should mention that.

Sparse neural networks have been the subject of research for a long time and this includes recurrent neural networks (e.g., sparse recurrent weight matrices were standard for echo-state networks [1]). The proposed method is also very similar to the work by Han et al. [2], where a threshold is used to prune weights after training, followed by a retraining phase of the remaining weights. While I think that it is certainly more elegant to replace this three stage procedure with a single training phase, the proposed scheme still contains multiple regimes that resemble such a process by first training without pruning followed by pruning at two different rates and finally training without further pruning again. The main novelty of the work would be the application of such a scheme to RNNs, which are typically more tricky to train than feedforward nets.

Improving scalability is an important driving force of the progress in neural network research. While I don’t think the paper presents much novelty in ideas or scientific insight, it does show that weight pruning can be successfully applied to large practical RNN systems without sacrificing much in performance. The fact that this is possible with such a simple heuristic is a result worth sharing.


Pros:
The proposed method is successful at reducing the number of parameters in RNNs substantially without sacrificing too much in performance.
The experiments are done using a state-of-the-art system for a practical application.

Cons:
The proposed method is very similar to earlier work and barely novel.
There is no comparison with other pruning methods.
The data is private and this prevents others from replicating the results.

Thanks to the authors for including a comparison to the previously published sparsity method of Yu et al., 2012.  The comparison is plausible, though it would be clearer if the authors were to state that the best comparison for the results in Table 4 is the ""RNN Sparse 1760"" result in Table 3.

I have updated my review to reflect my evaluation of the revised paper, although I am also leaving the original review in place to preserve the history of the paper.

This paper has three main contributions.  (1) It proposes an approach to training sparse RNNs in which weights falling below a given threshold are masked to zero, and a schedule is used for the threshold in which pruning is only applied after a certain number of iterations have been performed and the threshold increases over the course of training.  (2) It provides experimental results on a Baidu-internal task with the Deep Speech 2 network architecture showing that applying the sparsification to a large model can lead to a final, trained model which has better performance and fewer non-zero parameters than a dense baseline model.  (3) It provides results from timing experiments with the cuSPARSE library showing that there is some potential for faster model evaluation with sufficiently sparse models, but that the current cuSPARSE implementation may not be optimal.

Pros
+ The paper is mostly clear and easy to understand.
+ The paper tackles an important, practical problem in deep learning:  how to successfully deploy models at the lowest possible computational and memory cost.

Cons
- As a second baseline, this paper should compare to ""distillation"" approaches (e.g., ","{'SUBSTANCE': 3, 'ORIGINALITY': 2}"
