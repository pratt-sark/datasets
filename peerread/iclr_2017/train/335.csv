An Information-Theoretic Framework for Fast and Robust Unsupervised Learning via Neural Population Infomax,"A framework is presented for unsupervised learning of representations based on infomax principle for large-scale neural populations. We use an asymptotic approximation to the Shannon's mutual information for a large neural population to demonstrate that a good initial approximation to the global information-theoretic optimum can be obtained by a hierarchical infomax method. Starting from the initial solution, an efficient algorithm based on gradient descent of the final objective function is proposed to learn representations from the input datasets, and the method works for complete, overcomplete, and undercomplete bases. As confirmed by numerical experiments, our method is robust and highly efficient for extracting salient features from input datasets. Compared with the main existing methods, our algorithm has a distinct advantage in both the training speed and the robustness of unsupervised representation learning. Furthermore, the proposed method is easily extended to the supervised or unsupervised model for training deep structure networks.","This paper proposes a hierarchical infomax method. My comments are as follows: 

(1) First of all, this paper is 21 pages without appendix, and too long as a conference proceeding. Therefore, it is not easy for readers to follow the paper. The authors should make this paper as compact as possible while maintaining the important message. 

(2) One of the main contribution in this paper is to find a good initialization point by maximizing I(X;R). However, it is unclear why maximizing I(X;\breve{Y}) is good for maximizing I(X;R) because Proposition 2.1 shows that I(X;\breve{Y}) is an “upper” bound of I(X;R) (When it is difficult to directly maximize a function, people often maximize some tractable “lower” bound of it).

Minor comments:
(1) If (2.11) is approximation of (2.8), “\approx” should be used. 

(2) Why K_1 instead of N in Eq.(2.11)?

(3) In Eq.(2.12), H(X) should disappear?

(4) Can you divide Section 3 into subsections?

The original Bell & Sejnowski infomax framework only considered the no noise case.  Results are shown for natural image patches and the mnist dataset, which qualitatively resemble results obtained with other methods.

This seems like an interesting and potentially more general approach to unsupervised learning.  However the paper is quite long and it was difficult for me to follow all the twists and turns.  For example the introduction of the hierarchical model was confusing and it took several iterations to understand where this was going.  'Hierarchical' is probably not the right terminology here because it's not like a deep net hierarchy, it's just decomposing the tuning curve function into different parts.  I would recommend that the authors try to condense the paper so that the central message and important steps are conveyed in short order, and then put the more complete mathematical development into a supplementary document.

Also, the authors should look at the work of Karklin & Simoncelli 2011 which is highly related.  They also use an infomax framework for a noisy neural population to derive on and off cells in the retina, and they show the conditions under which orientation selectivity emerges.
