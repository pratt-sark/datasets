Neural Architecture Search with Reinforcement Learning,"Neural networks are powerful and flexible models that work well for many difficult learning tasks in image, speech and natural language understanding. Despite their success, neural networks are still hard to design. In this paper, we use a recurrent network to generate the model descriptions of neural networks and train this RNN with reinforcement learning to maximize the expected accuracy of the generated architectures on a validation set. On the CIFAR-10 dataset, our method, starting from scratch, can design a novel network architecture that rivals the best human-invented architecture in terms of test set accuracy. Our CIFAR-10 model achieves a test error rate of 3.65, which is 0.09 percent better and 1.05x faster than the previous state-of-the-art model that used a similar architectural scheme. On the Penn Treebank dataset, our model can compose a novel recurrent cell that outperforms the widely-used LSTM cell, and other state-of-the-art baselines.  Our cell achieves a test set perplexity of 62.4 on the Penn Treebank, which is 3.6 perplexity better than the previous state-of-the-art model. The cell can also be transferred to the character language modeling task on PTB and achieves a state-of-the-art perplexity of 1.214.","The paper reports that ""[a]fter the controller RNN is done training, we take the best RNN cell according to the lowest validation perplexity and then run a grid search over learning rate, weight initialization, dropout rates and decay epoch. The best cell found was then run with three different configurations and sizes to increase its capacity.""

Is it possible for you to include (or provide here) the hyperparameters and type of dropout (i.e. recurrent dropout, embedding dropout, ...) used? Without them, replication would at best require a great deal of trial and error. As with ""Recurrent Neural Network Regularization"" (Zaremba et al., 2014), releasing a base set of hyper parameters greatly assists in the future work of the field.

This will likely also be desired for the other experiments, such as character LM.","{'SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS': 5, 'ORIGINALITY': 4}"

While the technique is currently computationally intensive, this trade-off will likely become better in the near future as technology continues to improve.

The paper covers both standard vision and text tasks and tackle many benchmark datasets, showing there are gains to be made by exploring beyond the standard RNN and CNN search space. While one would always want to see the technique applied to more datasets, this is already far more sufficient to show the technique is not only competitive with human architectural intuition but may even surpass it. This also suggests an approach to tailor the architecture to specific datasets without resulting in hand engineering at each stage.

This is a well written paper on an interesting topic with strong results. I recommend it be accepted.","{'SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS': 5, 'ORIGINALITY': 4}"

The method treats DNN as a variable length sequence, and uses RL to find the target architecture, which acts as an actor. The node selection is an action in the RL context, and evaluation error of the outcome architecture corresponds to reward. A auto-regressive two-layer LSTM is used as a controller and critic. The method is evaluated on two different problems, and each compared with number of other human-created architectures.

This is very exciting paper! Hand selecting architectures is difficult, and it is hard to know how far from optimal results the hand-designed networks are. The presented method is  novel. The authors do an excellent job of describing it in detail, with all the improvements that needed to be done. The tested data represents well the capability of the method. It is very interesting to see the differences between the generated architectures and human generated ones. The paper is written very clearly, and is very accessible. The coverage and contrast with the related literature is done well.

It would be interesting to see the data about the time needed for training, and correlation between time/resources needed to train and the quality of the model. It would also be interesting to see how human bootstrapped models perform and involve.

Overall, an excellent and interesting paper.","{'ORIGINALITY': 2, 'CLARITY': 5}"

The idea of the paper is quite promising and the experimental results on two datasets show that method is solid.
The pros of the paper are:
1. The idea of using RNN to produce the description of the network and using RL to train the RNN is interesting and promising.
2. The generated architecture looks similar to what human designed, which shows that the human expertise and the generated network architectures are compatible.

The cons of the paper are:
1. The training time of the network is long, even with a lot of computing resources. 
2. The experiments did not provide the generality of the generated architectures. It would be nice to see the performances of the generated architecture on other similar but different datasets, especially the generated sequential models.

Overall, I believe this is a nice paper. But it need more experiments to show its potential advantage over the human designed models.","{'IMPACT': 5, 'SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS': 5, 'CLARITY': 5}"
