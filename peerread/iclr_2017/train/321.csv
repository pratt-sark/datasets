Stochastic Neural Networks for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning,"Deep reinforcement learning has achieved many impressive results in recent years. However, tasks with sparse rewards or long horizons continue to pose significant challenges. To tackle these important problems, we propose a general framework that first learns useful skills in a pre-training environment, and then leverages the acquired skills for learning faster in downstream tasks. Our approach brings together some of the strengths of intrinsic motivation and hierarchical methods: the learning of useful skill is guided by a single proxy reward, the design of which requires very minimal domain knowledge about the downstream tasks. Then a high-level policy is trained on top of these skills, providing a significant improvement of the exploration and allowing to tackle sparse rewards in the downstream tasks. To efficiently pre-train a large span of skills, we use Stochastic Neural Networks combined with an information-theoretic regularizer. Our experiments show that this combination is effective in learning a wide span of interpretable skills in a sample-efficient way, and can significantly boost the learning performance uniformly across a wide range of downstream tasks.","*Edited the score 6->7.

The paper presents a method for hierarchical RL using stochastic neural networks. The paper has introduced using information-theoretic measure of option identifiability as an additional reward for learning a diverse mixture of sub-policies. One nice result in the paper is the comparison with strong baseline which directly combines the intrinsic rewards with sparse rewards and shows that this supposedly smooth reward can’t solve tasks. Besides the argument made from the authors on difficulty on long-term credit assignment/benefits from hierarchical abstraction, one possible explanation for this might be the diversity requirement imposed in sub-policy training, which is assumed to be off in the baseline case. Wonder if this can shed insights into improving the baseline and proposing new end-to-end hierarchical policy learning as hierarchical REPS/option-critic etc. papers do. Nice visualizations.

The paper presents a promising direction, and it may be strengthened further by possibly addressing some of the following points. 

1) Limited diversification of sub-policies: Both concatenation and bilinear integration allow only minimal differentiations in sub-policies through first hidden weight, which is not a problem in the tested tasks because they essentially require same locomotion policies with minimal diversification, but such limitation can be more obvious in other tasks where ideal sub-policies are more diverse. Thus it is interesting to see it apply on harder, non-locomotion domains, where ideal sub-policies are not that similar, e.g. for manipulation, solving some task from one state can be very different from solving it from another state. 

2) Limitation on hierarchical policies: Manager network is trained while the sub-policies are fixed. Furthermore, the time steps for sub-policies are fixed. This requires “intrinsic” rewards and their learned sub-policies to be very good for solving down-stream tasks. It would be nice to see some more discussions/results on handling such cases, ideally connecting to end-to-end hierarchical policy learning.

3) Intrinsic/unsupervised rewards seem domain-specific/supervised rewards: Because of (2), this seems unavoidable.

(1) What are the failure model of this work? As richness of behaviors get complex, I expected this approach to have issues with the diversity of skills that could be discovered.

(2) Looking at Sec 5.3 -- "" let X be a random variable denoting the grid in which the agent is currently situated"" -- is the space discretized? And if so why and what happens if it isn't. 

(3) Expanding on the first point, does the approach work with more complicated embodiment? Say a 5-link swimmer instead of 2? I think this is important to assess the generality of this approach

I don't entirely agree with this. The rewards that this paper proposes are also quite hand-crafted and specific to a seemingly limited set of control tasks. ",{'ORIGINALITY': 4}
