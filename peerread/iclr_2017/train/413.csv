Sigma Delta Quantized Networks,"Deep neural networks can be obscenely wasteful. When processing video, a convolutional network expends a fixed amount of computation for each frame with no regard to the similarity between neighbouring frames. As a result, it ends up repeatedly doing very similar computations. To put an end to such waste, we introduce Sigma-Delta networks. With each new input, each layer in this network sends a discretized form of its change in activation to the next layer. Thus the amount of computation that the network does scales with the amount of change in the input and layer activations, rather than the size of the network. We introduce an optimization method for converting any pre-trained deep network into an optimally efficient Sigma-Delta network, and show that our algorithm, if run on the appropriate hardware, could cut at least an order of magnitude from the computational cost of processing video data.","This is an interesting paper about quantized networks that work on temporal difference inputs.  The basic idea is that when a network has only to process differences then this is computational much more efficient specifically with natural video data since large parts of an image would be fairly constant so that the network only has to process the informative sections of the image (video stream). This is of course how the human visual system works, and it is hence of interest even beyond the core machine learning community. 

As an aside, there is a strong community interested in event-based vision such as the group of Tobi Delbrück, and it might be interesting to connect to this community. This might even provide a reference for your comments on page 1.

I guess the biggest novel contribution is that a rounding network can be replaced by a sigma-delta network, but that the order of discretization and summation doe make some difference in the actual processing load. I think I followed the steps and 
Most of my questions have already been answers in the pre-review period. My only question remaining is on page 3, “It should be noted that when we refer to “temporal differences”, we refer not to the change in the signal over time, but in the change between two inputs presented sequentially. The output of our network only depends on the value and order of inputs, not on the temporal spacing between them.”

This does not make sense to me. As I understand you just take the difference between two frames regardless if you call this temporal or not it is a change in one frame. So this statement rather confuses me and maybe should be dropped unless I do miss something here, in which case some more explanation would be necessary.

Figure 1 should be made bigger.

An improvement of the paper that I could think about is a better discussion of the relevance of the findings. Yes, you do show that your sigma-delta network save some operation compared to threshold, but is this difference essential for a specific task, or does your solution has relevance for neuroscience?
