"Learning to Query, Reason, and Answer Questions On Ambiguous Texts","A key goal of research in conversational systems is to train an interactive agent to help a user with a task. Human conversation, however, is notoriously incomplete, ambiguous, and full of extraneous detail. To operate effectively, the agent must not only understand what was explicitly conveyed but also be able to reason in the presence of missing or unclear information. When unable to resolve ambiguities on its own, the agent must be able to ask the user for the necessary clarifications and incorporate the response in its reasoning. Motivated by this problem we introduce QRAQ (""crack""; Query, Reason, and Answer Questions), a new synthetic domain, in which a User gives an Agent a short story and asks a challenge question. These problems are designed to test the reasoning and interaction capabilities of a learning-based Agent in a setting that requires multiple conversational turns. A good Agent should ask only non-deducible, relevant questions until it has enough information to correctly answer the User's question. We use standard and improved reinforcement learning based memory-network architectures to solve QRAQ problems in the difficult setting where the reward signal only tells the Agent if its final answer to the challenge question is correct or not. To provide an upper-bound to the RL results we also train the same architectures using supervised information that tells the Agent during training which variables to query and the answer to the challenge question. We evaluate our architectures on four QRAQ dataset types, and scale the complexity for each along multiple dimensions.","This paper proposed an integration of memory network with reinforcement learning. The experimental data is simple, but the model is very interesting and relatively novel. There are some questions about the model:

1. how does the model extend to the case with multiple variables in a single sentence?

2. If the answer is out of vocabulary, how would the model handle it?

3. I hope the authors can provide more analysis about the curriculum learning part, since it is very important for the RL model training.

4. In the training, in each iteration, how the data samples were selected, by random or from simple one depth to multiple depth?

In particular, some of the people and objects in the scenarios are replaced with unknown variables. Some of these variables must be known to solve the question, thus the agent must learn to query for the values of these variables. Interestingly, one can now measure both the performance of the agent in correctly answering the question, and its efficiency in asking for the values of the correct unknown variables (and not variables that are unnecessary to answer the question). This inferring of unknown variables goes beyond what is required for the vanilla version of the bAbI tasks, which are now more or less solved.

The paper is well-written, and the contributions are clear. Due to the very limited vocabulary and structure of the bAbI problems in general, I think these tasks (and variants on them) should be viewed more as basic reasoning tasks than natural language understanding. I’m not convinced by the claim of the paper that this really tests the ‘interaction’ capabilities of agents – while the task is phrased as a kind of interaction, I think it’s more aptly described by simply ‘inferring important unknown variables’, which (while important) is more related to reasoning. I’m not sure whether the connection of this ability to ‘interaction’ is more a superficial one.

That being said, it is certainly true that conversational agents will need basic reasoning abilities to converse meaningfully with humans. I sympathise with the general goal of the bAbI tasks, which is to test these reasoning abilities in synthetic environments, that are just complicated enough (but not more) to drive the construction of interesting models. I am convinced by the authors that their extension to these tasks are interesting and worthy of future investigation, and thus I recommend the acceptance of the paper.
