"Snapshot Ensembles: Train 1, Get M for Free","Ensembles of neural networks are known to be much more robust and accurate than individual networks. However, training multiple deep networks for model averaging is computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a method to obtain the seemingly contradictory goal of ensembling multiple neural networks at no additional training cost. We achieve this goal by training a single neural network, converging to several local minima along its optimization path and saving the model parameters.  To obtain repeated rapid convergence, we leverage recent work on cyclic learning rate schedules. The resulting technique, which we refer to as Snapshot Ensembling, is simple, yet surprisingly effective.  We show in a series of experiments that our approach is compatible with diverse network architectures and learning tasks. It consistently yields  lower error rates than state-of-the-art single models at no additional training cost, and compares favorably with traditional network ensembles. On CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 our DenseNet Snapshot Ensembles obtain error rates of 3.4% and 17.4% respectively.","I don't have much to add to my pre-review questions. The main thing I'd like to see that would strengthen my review further is a larger scale evaluation, more discussion of the hyperparameters, etc. Where test error are reported for snapshot ensembles it would be useful to report statistics about the performance of individual ensemble members for comparison (mean and standard deviation, maybe best single member's error rate).",{'SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS': 4}

Network is trained using a cyclic (cosine) learning rate schedule; the snapshots are obtained when the learning rate is at the lowest points of the cycles. Using these snapshot ensembles, they show gains in performance over a single network on the image classification task on a variety of datasets.


Positives:

1. The work should be easy to adopt and re-produce, given the simple techinque and the experimental details in the paper.
2. Well written paper, with clear description of the method and thorough experiments.


Suggestions for improvement / other comments:

1. While it is fair to compare against other techniques assuming a fixed computational budget, for a clear perspective, thorough comaprisons with ""true ensembles"" (i.e., ensembles of networks trained independently) should be provided.
Specificially, Table 4 should be augmented with results from ""true ensembles"".

2. Comparison with true ensembles is only provided for DenseNet-40 on CIFAR100 in Figure 4. The proposed snapshot ensemble achieves approximately 66% of the improvement of ""true ensemble"" over the single baseline model. This is not reflected accurately in the authors' claim in the abstract: ""[snapshot ensembles] **almost match[es]** the results of far more expensive independently trained [true ensembles].""

3. As mentioned before: to understand the diversity of snapshot ensembles, it would help to the diversity against different ensembling technique, e.g. (1) ""true ensembles"", (2) ensembles from dropout as described by Gal et. al, 2016 (Dropout as a Bayesian Approximation).","{'SUBSTANCE': 3, 'SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS': 5, 'CLARITY': 4}"
