Generative Multi-Adversarial Networks,"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a framework for producing a generative model by way of a two-player minimax game.  In this paper, we propose the \emph{Generative Multi-Adversarial Network} (GMAN), a framework that extends GANs to multiple discriminators. In previous work, the successful training of GANs requires modifying the minimax objective to accelerate training early on. In contrast, GMAN can be reliably trained with the original, untampered objective. We explore a number of design perspectives with the discriminator role ranging from formidable adversary to forgiving teacher.  Image generation tasks comparing the proposed framework to standard GANs demonstrate GMAN produces higher quality samples in a fraction of the iterations when measured by a pairwise GAM-type metric.","This work brings multiple discriminators into GAN. From the result, multiple discriminators is useful for stabilizing. 

The main problem of stabilizing seems is from gradient signal from discriminator, the authors motivation is using multiple discriminators to reduce this effect.

I think this work indicates the direction is promising, however I think the authors may consider to add more result vs approach which enforce discriminator gradient, such as GAN with DAE (Improving Generative Adversarial Networks with Denoising Feature Matching), to show advantages of multiple discriminators.","{'IMPACT': 1, 'SUBSTANCE': 3, 'MEANINGFUL_COMPARISON': 3, 'ORIGINALITY': 3}"

This comes with a number of benefits, mainly being able to use less powerful discriminators which may provide better training signal to the generator early on in training when strong discriminators might overpower the generator.

My main comment is about the way the paper is presented. The caption of Figure 1. and Section 3.1 suggests using the best discriminator by taking the maximum over the performance of individual ensemble members. This does not appear to be the best thing to do because we are just bound to get a training signal that is stricter than any of the individual members of the ensemble. Then the rest of the paper explores relaxing the maximum and considers various averaging techniques to obtain a ’soft-discriminator’. To me, this idea is far more appealing, and the results seem to support this, too. Skimming the paper it seems as if the authors mainly advocated always using the strongest discriminator, evidenced by my premature pre-review question earlier.

Overall, I think this paper is a valuable contribution, and I think the idea of multiple discriminators is an interesting direction to pursue.",{'ORIGINALITY': 4}
