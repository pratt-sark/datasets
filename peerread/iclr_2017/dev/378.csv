Improving Policy Gradient by Exploring Under-appreciated Rewards,"This paper presents a novel form of policy gradient for model-free reinforcement learning (RL) with improved exploration properties. Current policy-based methods use entropy regularization to encourage undirected exploration of the reward landscape, which is ineffective in high dimensional spaces with sparse rewards. We propose a more directed exploration strategy that promotes exploration of under-appreciated reward regions. An action sequence is considered under-appreciated if its log-probability under the current policy under-estimates its resulting reward. The proposed exploration strategy is easy to implement, requiring only small modifications to the standard REINFORCE algorithm. We evaluate the approach on a set of algorithmic tasks that have long challenged RL methods. We find that our approach reduces hyper-parameter sensitivity and demonstrates significant improvements over baseline methods. Notably, the approach is able to solve a benchmark multi-digit addition task. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a pure RL method has solved addition using only reward feedback.","This paper proposes a novel exploration strategy that promotes exploration of under-appreciated reward regions. Proposed importance sampling based approach is a simple modification to REINFORCE and experiments in several algorithmic toy tasks show that the proposed model is performing better than REINFORCE and Q-learning.

This paper shows promising results in automated algorithm discovery using reinforcement learning. However it is not very clear what is the main motivation of the paper. Is the main motivation better exploration for policy gradient methods? If so, authors should have benchmarked their algorithm with standard reinforcement learning tasks. While there is a huge body of literature on improving REINFORCE, authors have considered a simple version of REINFORCE on a non-standard task and say that UREX is better. If the main motivation is improving the performance in algorithm learning tasks, then the baselines are still weak. Authors should make it clear which is the main motivation.

Also the action space is too small. In the beginning authors raise the concern that entropy regularization might not scale to larger action spaces. So a comparison of MENT and UREX in a large action space problem would give more insights on whether UREX is not affected by large action space.

--------------------------
After rebuttal:
I missed the action sequences argument when I pointed about small action space issue.

For question regarding weak baseline, there are several tricks used in the literature to tackle high-variance issue for REINFORCE. For example, see Mnih & Gregor, 2014.

I have increased my rating from 6 to 7. I still encourage the authors to improve their baseline.

To our knowledge, this is the first time that a pure RL method has solved addition using only reward feedback.","The paper proposes a new algorithm based on REINFORCE which aims at exploring under-appreciate action sequences. The idea is to compare the probability of a sequence of actions under the current policy with the estimated reward. Actions where the current policy under-estimate the reward will provide a higher feedback, thus encouraging exploration of particular sequences of actions. The UREX model is tested on 6 algortihmic RL problems and show interesting properties in comparison to the standard regularized REINFORCE (MENT) model and to Q-Learning.

The model is interesting, well defined and well explained. As far as I know, the UREX model is an original model which will certainly be useful for the RL community. The only drawback of the paper is to restrict the evaluation of this algortihm to algorithmic problems that are specific while it would be easy to test the proposed model onto other standard RL problems. This would clearly help to make the article stronger and I greatly encourage the authors to add some other tasks in their paper. ","{'SUBSTANCE': 2, 'CLARITY': 4}"
