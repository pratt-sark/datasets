TopicRNN: A Recurrent Neural Network with Long-Range Semantic Dependency,"In this paper, we propose TopicRNN, a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based language model designed to directly capture the global semantic meaning relating words in a document via latent topics. Because of their sequential nature, RNNs are good at capturing the local structure of a word sequence – both semantic and syntactic – but might face difficulty remembering long-range dependencies. Intuitively, these long-range dependencies are of semantic nature. In contrast, latent topic models are able to capture the global underlying semantic structure of a document but do not account for word ordering. The proposed TopicRNN model integrates the merits of RNNs and latent topic models: it captures local (syntactic) dependencies using an RNN and global (semantic) dependencies using latent topics. Unlike previous work on contextual RNN language modeling, our model is learned end-to-end. Empirical results on word prediction show that TopicRNN outperforms existing contextual RNN baselines. In addition, TopicRNN can be used as an unsupervised feature extractor for documents. We do this for sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie review dataset and report an error rate of 6.28%. This is comparable to the state-of-the-art 5.91% resulting from a semi-supervised approach. Finally, TopicRNN also yields sensible topics, making it a useful alternative to document models such as latent Dirichlet allocation.","This paper introduces a model that blends ideas from generative topic models with those from recurrent neural network language models. The authors evaluate the proposed approach on a document level classification benchmark as well as a language modeling benchmark and it seems to work well. There is also some analysis as to topics learned by the model and its ability to generate text. Overall the paper is clearly written and with the code promised by the authors others should be able to re-implement the approach. I have 2 potentially major questions I would ask the authors to address:

1 - LDA topic models make an exchangability (bag of words) assumption. The discussion of the generative story for TopicRNN should explicitly discuss whether this assumption is also made. On the surface it appears it is since y_t is sampled using only the document topic vector and h_t but we know that in practice h_t comes from a recurrent model that observes y_t-1. Not clear how this clean exposition of the generative model relates to what is actually done. In the Generating sequential text section it’s clear the topic model can’t generate words without using y_1 - t-1 but this seems inconsistent with the generative model specification. This needs to be shown in the paper and made clear to have a complete paper.


2 -  The topic model only allows for linear interactions of the topic vector theta. It seems like this might be required to keep the generative model tractable but seems like a very poor assumption. We would expect the topic representation to have rich interactions with a language model to create nonlinear adjustments to word probabilities for a document. Please add discussion as to why this modeling choice exists and if possible how future work could modify that assumption (or explain why it’s not such a bad assumption as one might imagine)

Experiments on two tasks are performed: language modeling on PTB, and sentiment analysis on IMBD. 
The authors show that TopicRNN outperforms vanilla RNN on PTB and achieves SOTA result on IMDB.

Some questions and comments:
- In Table 2, how do you use LDA features for RNN (RNN LDA features)? 
- I would like to see results from LSTM included here, even though it is lower perplexity than TopicRNN. I think it's still useful to see how much adding latent topics close the gap between RNN and LSTM.
- The generated text in Table 3 are not meaningful to me. What is this supposed to highlight? Is this generated text for topic ""trading""? What about the IMDB one?
- How scalable is the proposed method for large vocabulary size (>10K)?
- What is the accuracy on IMDB if the extracted features is used directly to perform classification? (instead of being passed to a neural network with one hidden state). I think this is a fairer comparison to BoW, LDA, and SVM methods presented as baselines. ","{'ORIGINALITY': 2, 'CLARITY': 3}"
