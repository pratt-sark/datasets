Designing Neural Network Architectures using Reinforcement Learning,"At present, designing convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures requires both human expertise and labor. New architectures are handcrafted by careful experimentation or modified from a handful of existing networks. We introduce MetaQNN, a meta-modeling algorithm based on reinforcement learning to automatically generate high-performing CNN architectures for a given learning task. The learning agent is trained to sequentially choose CNN layers using $Q$-learning with an $\epsilon$-greedy exploration strategy and experience replay. The agent explores a large but finite space of possible architectures and iteratively discovers designs with improved performance on the learning task. On image classification benchmarks, the agent-designed networks (consisting of only standard convolution, pooling, and fully-connected layers) beat existing networks designed with the same layer types and are competitive against the state-of-the-art methods that use more complex layer types. We also outperform existing meta-modeling approaches for network design on image classification tasks.","This paper introduces a reinforcement learning framework for designing a neural network architecture. For each time-step, the agent picks a new layer type with corresponding layer parameters (e.g., #filters). In order to reduce the size of state-action space, they used a small set of design choices.

Strengths:
- A novel approach for automatic design of neural network architectures.
- Shows quite promising results on several datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10).

Weakness:
- Limited architecture design choices due to many prior assumptions (e.g., a set of possible number of convolution filters, at most 2 fully-connected layers, maximum depth, hard-coded dropout, etc.)
- The method is demonstrated in tabular Q-learning setting, but it is unclear whether the proposed method would work in a large state-action space.

Overall, this is an interesting and novel approach for neural network architecture design, and it seems to be worth publication despite some weaknesses.","{'IMPACT': 4, 'MEANINGFUL_COMPARISON': 3, 'ORIGINALITY': 3}"

I am mostly concerned about the computational cost of the method. 8-10 days on 10 GPUs for relatively tiny datasets is quite prohibitive for most applications I would ever encounter.
 I think the main question is how this approach scales to larger images and also when applied to more exotic and possibly tiny datasets. Can you run an experiment on Caltech-101 for instance? I would be very curious to see if your approach is suitable for the low-data regime and areas where we all do not know right away how a suitable architecture looks like. For Cifar-10/100, MNIST and SVHN, everyone knows very well what a reasonable model initialization looks like.

If you show proof that you can discover a competitive architecture for something like Caltech-101, I would recommend the paper for publication.

Minor: 
- ResNets should be mentioned in Table ","{'IMPACT': 2, 'APPROPRIATENESS': 3, 'ORIGINALITY': 5, 'CLARITY': 5}"
