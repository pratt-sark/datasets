Semi-supervised Knowledge Transfer for Deep Learning from Private Training Data,"Some machine learning applications involve training data that is sensitive, such as the medical histories of patients in a clinical trial. A model may inadvertently and implicitly store some of its training data; careful analysis of the model may therefore reveal sensitive information.  To address this problem, we demonstrate a generally applicable approach to providing strong privacy guarantees for training data: Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE). The approach combines, in a black-box fashion, multiple models trained with disjoint datasets, such as records from different subsets of users. Because they rely directly on sensitive data, these models are not published, but instead used as ''teachers'' for a ''student'' model.  The student learns to predict an output chosen by noisy voting among all of the teachers, and cannot directly access an individual teacher or the underlying data or parameters. The student's privacy properties can be understood both intuitively (since no single teacher and thus no single dataset dictates the student's training) and formally, in terms of differential privacy.  These properties hold even if an adversary can not only query the student but also inspect its internal workings.  Compared with previous work, the approach imposes only weak assumptions on how teachers are trained: it applies to any model, including non-convex models like DNNs. We achieve state-of-the-art privacy/utility trade-offs on MNIST and SVHN thanks to an improved privacy analysis and semi-supervised learning.","This paper addresses the problem of achieving differential privacy in a very general scenario where a set of teachers is trained on disjoint subsets of sensitive data and the student performs prediction based on public data labeled by teachers through noisy voting. I found the approach altogether plausible and very clearly explained by the authors. Adding more discussion of the bound (and its tightness) from Theorem 1 itself would be appreciated. A simple idea of adding perturbation error to the counts, known from differentially-private literature, is nicely re-used by the authors and elegantly applied in a much broader (non-convex setting) and practical context than in a number of differentially-private and other related papers. The generality of the approach, clear improvement over predecessors, and clarity of the writing makes the method worth publishing.","{'IMPACT': 4, 'ORIGINALITY': 5, 'CLARITY': 5}"

In the proposed approach multiple models trained with disjoint datasets are used as ``teachers'' model, which will train a ``student'' model to predict an output chosen by noisy voting among all of the teachers. 

The theoretical results are nice but also intuitive. Since teachers' result are provided via noisy voting, the student model may not duplicate the teacher's behavior. However, the probabilistic bound has quite a number of  empirical parameters, which makes me difficult to decide whether the security is 100% guaranteed or not.

The experiments on MNIST and SVHN are good. However, as the paper claims, the proposed approach may be mostly useful for sensitive data like medical histories, it will be nice to conduct one or two experiments on such applications. ","{'ORIGINALITY': 5, 'CLARITY': 5}"

The work advances the state of the art on differentially-private deep learning, is quite well-written, and relatively thorough.

One caveat is that although the approach is intended to be general, no theoretical guarantees are provided about the learning performance. Privacy-preserving machine learning papers often analyze both the privacy (in the worst case, DP setting) and the learning performance (often under different assumptions). Since the learning performance might depend on the choice of architecture; future experimentation is encouraged, even using the same data sets, with different architectures. If this will not be added, then please justify the choice of architecture used, and/or clarify what can be generalized about the observed learning performance.

Another caveat is that the reported epsilons are not those that can be privately released; the authors note that their technique for doing so would change the resulting epsilon. However this would need to be resolved in order to have a meaningful comparison to the epsilon-delta values reported in related work.

Finally, as has been acknowledged in the paper, the present approach may not work on other natural data types. Experiments on other data sets is strongly encouraged. Also, please cite the data sets used.

Other comments:

Discussion of certain parts of the related work are thorough. However, please add some survey/discussion of the related work on differentially-private semi-supervised learning. For example, in the context of random forests, the following paper also proposed differentially-private semi-supervised learning via a teacher-learner approach (although not denoted as “teacher-learner”). The only time the private labeled data is used is when learning the “primary ensemble.”  A ""secondary ensemble"" is then learned only from the unlabeled (non-private) data, with pseudo-labels generated by the primary ensemble.

Section C. does a nice comparison of approaches. Please make sure the quantitative results here constitute an apples-to-apples comparison with the GAN results. 

The paper is extremely well-written, for the most part. Some places needing clarification include:
- Last paragraph of 3.1. “all teachers….get the same training data….” This should be rephrased to make it clear that it is not the same w.r.t. all the teachers, but w.r.t. the same teacher on the neighboring database.
- 4.1: The authors state: “The number n of teachers is limited by a trade-off between the classification task’s complexity and the available data.” However, since this tradeoff is not formalized, the statement is imprecise. In particular, if the analysis is done in the i.i.d. setting, the tradeoff would also likely depend on the relation of the target hypothesis to the data distribution.
- Discussion of figure 3 was rather unclear in the text and caption and should be revised for clarity. In the text section, at first the explanation seems to imply that a larger gap is better (as is also indicated in the caption). However later it is stated that the gap stays under 20%. These sentences seem contradictory, which is likely not what was intended.","{'IMPACT': 5, 'APPROPRIATENESS': 5, 'ORIGINALITY': 5, 'CLARITY': 5}"
