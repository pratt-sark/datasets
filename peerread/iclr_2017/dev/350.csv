Deep Predictive Coding Networks for Video Prediction and Unsupervised Learning,"While great strides have been made in using deep learning algorithms to solve supervised learning tasks, the problem of unsupervised learning - leveraging unlabeled examples to learn about the structure of a domain - remains a difficult unsolved challenge. Here, we explore prediction of future frames in a video sequence as an unsupervised learning rule for learning about the structure of the visual world. We describe a predictive neural network (""PredNet"") architecture that is inspired by the concept of ""predictive coding"" from the neuroscience literature. These networks learn to predict future frames in a video sequence, with each layer in the network making local predictions and only forwarding deviations from those predictions to subsequent network layers. We show that these networks are able to robustly learn to predict the movement of synthetic (rendered) objects, and that in doing so, the networks learn  internal representations that are useful for decoding latent object parameters (e.g. pose) that support object recognition with fewer training views. We also show that these networks can scale to complex natural image streams (car-mounted camera videos), capturing key aspects of both egocentric movement and the movement of objects in the visual scene, and the representation learned in this setting is useful for estimating the steering angle. These results suggest that prediction represents a powerful framework for unsupervised learning, allowing for implicit learning of object and scene structure.","An interesting architecture that accumulates and continuously corrects mistakes as you see more and more of a video sequence.

Clarity: The video you generated seems very helpful towards understanding the information flow in your network, it would be nice to link to it from the paper.

 ""Our model with hyperparameters optimized for KITTI underperforms the model of Finn et al. (2016), but outperforms the previous state-of-the-art model by Mathieu et al. (2016).""

 It is not clear how different are the train and test sequences at the moment, since standard benchmarks do not really exist for video prediction and each author picks his/her favorite. Underperforming Finn et al 206 at the H3.6m Walking videos is a bit disappointing.

In this paper, the authors investigate how the prediction of future image frames (inherently unsupervised) can help to deduce object/s structure and it's properties (in this case single object pose, category, and steering angle, (after a supervised linear readout step))

I enjoyed reading this paper, it is clear, interesting and proposes an original network architecture (PredNet) for video frame prediction that has produced promising results on both synthetic and natural images.
Moreover, the extensive experimental evaluation and analysis the authors provide puts it on solid ground to which others can compare.

The weaknesses:
- the link to predictive coding should be better explained in the paper if it is to be used as a motivation for the prednet model.
- any idea that the proposed method is learning an implicit `model' of the `objects' that make up the `scene' is vague and far fetched, but it sounds great.

Minor comment:
Next to the number of labeled training examples (Fig.5), it would be interesting to see how much unsupervised training data was used to train your representations.",{'ORIGINALITY': 4}

This paper proposes an unsupervised learning model in which the network
predicts what its state would look like at the next time step (at input layer
and potentially other layers).  When these states are observed, an error signal
is computed by comparing the predictions and the observations. This error
signal is fed back into the model. The authors show that this model is able to
make good predictions on a toy dataset of rotating 3D faces as well as on
natural videos. They also show that these features help perform supervised
tasks.

Strengths
- The model is an interesting embodiment of the idea of predictive coding
  implemented using a end-to-end backpropable recurrent neural network architecture.
- The idea of feeding forward an error signal is perhaps not used as widely as it could
  be, and this work shows a compelling example of using it. 
- Strong empirical results and relevant comparisons show that the model works well.
- The authors present a detailed ablative analysis of the proposed model.

Weaknesses
- The model (esp. in Fig 1) is presented as a generalized predictive model
  where next step predictions are made at each layer. However, as discovered by
running the experiments, only the predictions at the input layer are the ones
that actually matter and the optimal choice seems to be to turn off the error
signal from the higher layers. While the authors intend to address this in future
work, I think this point merits some more discussion in the current work, given
the way this model is presented.
- The network currently lacks stochasticity and does not model the future as a
  multimodal distribution (However, this is mentioned as potential future work).

Quality
The experiments are well-designed and a detailed analysis is provided
in the appendix.

Clarity
The paper is well-written and easy to follow.

Originality
Some deep models have previously been proposed that use predictive coding.
However, the proposed model is most probably novel in the way it feds back the
error signal and implements the entire model as a single differentiable
network.

Significance
This paper will be of wide interest to the growing set of researchers working
in unsupervised learning of time series. This helps draw attention to
predictive coding as an important learning paradigm.

Overall
Good paper with detailed and well-designed experiments. The idea of feeding
forward the error signal is not being used as much as it could be in our
community. This work helps to draw the community's attention to this idea.","{'MEANINGFUL_COMPARISON': 2, 'ORIGINALITY': 4, 'CLARITY': 5}"
