Multilayer Recurrent Network Models of Primate Retinal Ganglion Cell Responses,"Developing accurate predictive models of sensory neurons is vital to understanding sensory processing and brain computations. The current standard approach to modeling neurons is to start with simple models and to incrementally add interpretable features. An alternative approach is to start with a more complex model that captures responses accurately, and then probe the fitted model structure to understand the neural computations. Here, we show that a multitask recurrent neural network (RNN) framework provides the flexibility necessary to model complex computations of neurons that cannot be captured by previous methods. Specifically, multilayer recurrent neural networks that share features across neurons outperform generalized linear models (GLMs) in predicting the spiking responses of parasol ganglion cells in the primate retina to natural images. The networks achieve good predictive performance given surprisingly small amounts of experimental training data. Additionally, we present a novel GLM-RNN hybrid model with separate spatial and temporal processing components which provides insights into the aspects of retinal processing better captured by the recurrent neural networks.","This paper explores the ability of nonlinear recurrent neural networks to account for neural response properties that have otherwise eluded the ability of other models.  A multilayer rnn is trained to imitate the stimulus-response mapping measured from actual retinal ganglion cells in response to a sequence of natural images.  The rnn performs significantly better, especially in accounting for transient responses, than conventional LN/GLM models.

This work is an important step in understanding the nonlinear response properties of visual neurons.  Recent results have shown that the responses of even retinal ganglion cells in response to natural movies are difficult to explain in terms of standard receptive field models.  So this presents an important challenge to the field.  If we even had *a* model that works, it would be a starting point.  So this work should be seen in that light.  The challenge now of course is to tease apart what the rnn is doing.  Perhaps it could now be pruned and simplified to see what parts are critical to performance.  It would have been nice to see such an analysis.   Nevertheless this result is a good first start and I think important for people to know about.

I am a bit confused about what is being called a ""movie.""  My understanding is that it is essentially a sequence of unrelated images shown for 1 sec. each.  But then it is stated that the ""frame rate"" is 1/8.33 ms.  I think this must refer to the refresh rate of the monitor, right?   

I would guess that the deviations from the LN model are even stronger when you show actual dynamic natural scenes - i.e., real movies.  Here I would expect the rnn to have an even more profound effect, and potentially be much more informative.

I think the title should thus include the word “activity” at the end for otherwise it is actually formally incorrect.

Anyhow, this paper proposes more specifically a recurrent network for this time series prediction and compares it to what seems to be the previous approach of a generalized linear model. Overall the stated paradigm is that when one can predict the spikes well then one can look into the model and learn how nature does it. 

In general the paper sounds plausible, though I am not convinced that I learned a lot. The results in figure 2 show that the RNN model can predict the spikes a bit better. So this is nice. But now what? You have shown that a more complicated model can produce better fits to the data, though there are of course still some variations to the real data. Your initial outline was that a better predictive model helps you to better understand the neural processing in the retina. So tell us what you learned. I am not a specialist of the retina, but I know that there are several layers and recurrencies in the retina, so I am not so surprised that the new model is better than the GLM. 

It seems that more complicated recurrent models such as LSTM do not improve the performance according to a statement in the paper. However, comparisons on this level are also difficult as a more complex models needs more data. Hence, I would actually expect that more layers and even a more detailed model of the retina could eventually improve the prediction even further. 
I was also a bit puzzled that all the neurons in the network share all the same parameters (weights). While the results show that these simplified models can capture a lot of the spike train characteristics, couldn’t a model with free parameters eventually outperform this one (with correspondingly more training data)?
