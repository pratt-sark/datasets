Autoencoding Variational Inference For Topic Models,"Topic models are one of the most popular methods for learning representations of text, but a major challenge is that any change to the topic model requires mathematically deriving a new inference algorithm. A promising approach to address this problem is autoencoding variational Bayes (AEVB), but it has proven diffi- cult to apply to topic models in practice. We present what is to our knowledge the first effective AEVB based inference method for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), which we call Autoencoded Variational Inference For Topic Model (AVITM). This model tackles the problems caused for AEVB by the Dirichlet prior and by component collapsing. We find that AVITM matches traditional methods in accuracy with much better inference time. Indeed, because of the inference network, we find that it is unnecessary to pay the computational cost of running variational optimization on test data. Because AVITM is black box, it is readily applied to new topic models. As a dramatic illustration of this, we present a new topic model called ProdLDA, that replaces the mixture model in LDA with a product of experts. By changing only one line of code from LDA, we find that ProdLDA yields much more interpretable topics, even if LDA is trained via collapsed Gibbs sampling.","The authors propose NVI for LDA variants. The authors compare NVI-LDA to standard inference schemes such as CGS and online SVI. The authors also evaluate NVI on a different model ProdLDA (not sure this model has been proposed before in the topic modeling literature though?)

In general, I like the direction of this paper and NVI looks promising for LDA. The experimental results however confound model vs inference which makes it hard to understand the significance of the results. Furthermore, the authors don't discuss hyper-parameter selection which is known to significantly impact performance of topic models. This makes it hard to understand when the proposed method can be expected to work. 

Can you maybe generate synthetic datasets with different Dirichlet distributions and assess when the proposed method recovers the true parameters?

Figure 1: Is this prior or posterior? The text talks about sparsity whereas the y-axis reads ""log p(topic proportions)"" which is a bit confusing.

Section 3.2: it is not clear what you mean by unimodal in softmax basis. Consider a Dirichlet on K-dimensional simplex with concentration parameter alpha/K where alpha<1 makes it multimodal. Isn't the softmax basis still multimodal?

None of the numbers include error bars. Are the results statistically significant?


Minor comments:

Last term in equation (3) is not ""error""; reconstruction accuracy or negative reconstruction error perhaps?

The idea of using an inference network is much older, cf. Helmholtz machine.

Some comments:
Eqn 5: I find the notation p(theta(h)|alpha) awkward. Why not P(h|alpha) ?
The generative model seems agnostic to document length, meaning that the latent variables only generate probabilities over word space. However, the recognition model is happy to radically change the probabilities q(z|x) if the document length changes because the input to q changes. This seems undesirable. Maybe they should normalize the input to the recognition network?
The ProdLDA model might well be equivalent to exponential family PCA or some variant thereof: ","{'MEANINGFUL_COMPARISON': 3, 'SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS': 3}"
