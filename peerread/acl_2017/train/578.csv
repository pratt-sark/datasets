Robust Incremental Neural Semantic Graph Parsing,"Parsing sentences to linguistically-expressive semantic representations is a key goal of Natural Language Processing. Yet statistical parsing has focussed almost exclusively on bilexical dependencies or domain-specific logical forms. We propose a neural encoder-decoder transition-based parser which is the first full-coverage semantic graph parser for Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS). The model architecture uses stack-based embedding features, predicting graphs jointly with unlexicalized predicates and their token alignments. Our parser is more accurate than attention-based baselines on MRS, and on an additional Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) benchmark, and GPU batch processing makes it an order of magnitude faster than a high-precision grammar-based parser. Further, the 86.69% Smatch score of our MRS parser is higher than the upper-bound on AMR parsing, making MRS an attractive choice as a semantic representation.","{'IMPACT': '4', 'SUBSTANCE': '5', 'APPROPRIATENESS': '5', 'MEANINGFUL_COMPARISON': '4', 'SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS': '3', 'ORIGINALITY': '4', 'CLARITY': '4'}","- Strengths:
The paper proposes an end-to-end neural model for semantic graph parsing,
based on a well-designed transition system. 
The work is interesting, learning
semantic representations of DMRS, which is capable of resolving semantics
such as scope underspecification. This work shows a new scheme for
computational semantics, benefiting from an end-to-end transition-based
incremental framework, which resolves the parsing with low cost.

- Weaknesses:
  My major concern is that the paper only gives a very common introduction for
the
definition of DMRS and EP, and the example even makes me a little confused
because I cannot see anything special for DMRS. The description can be a little
more detailed, I think. However, upon the space limitation, it is
understandable. The same problem exists for the transition system of the
parsing model. If I do not have any background of MRS and EP, I can hardly
learn something from the paper, just seeing that this paper is very good.

- General Discussion:
  Overall, this paper is very interesting to me. I like the DMRS for semantic
parsing very much and like the paper very much. Hope that the open-source codes
and datasets can make this line of research being a hot topic."
