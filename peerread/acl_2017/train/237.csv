A New Approach for Measuring Sentiment Orientation based on Multi-Dimensional Vector Space,"This study implements a vector space model approach to measure the sentiment orientations of words. Two representative vectors for positive/negative polarity are constructed using high-dimensional vec-tor space in both an unsupervised and a semi-supervised manner. A sentiment ori-entation value per word is determined by taking the difference between the cosine distances against the two reference vec-tors. These two conditions (unsupervised and semi-supervised) are compared against an existing unsupervised method (Turney, 2002). As a result of our experi-ment, we demonstrate that this novel ap-proach significantly outperforms the pre-vious unsupervised approach and is more practical and data efficient as well.","{'IMPACT': '3', 'SUBSTANCE': '1', 'APPROPRIATENESS': '5', 'MEANINGFUL_COMPARISON': '3', 'SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS': '3', 'ORIGINALITY': '3', 'CLARITY': '3'}","# Summary

This paper presents an empirical study to identify a latent dimension of
sentiment in word embeddings.

# Strengths

 S1) Tackles a challenging problem of unsupervised sentiment analysis.

 S2) Figure 2, in particular, is a nice visualisation.

# Weaknesses

 W1) The experiments, in particular, are very thin. I would recommend also
measuring F1 performance and expanding the number of techniques compared.

 W2) The methodology description needs more organisation and elaboration. The
ideas tested are itemised, but insufficiently justified. 

 W3) The results are quite weak in terms of the reported accuracy and depth of
analysis. Perhaps this work needs more development, particularly with
validating the central assumption that the Distributional Hypothesis implies
that opposite words, although semantically similar, are separated well in the
vector space?"

This paper deals with the issue of finding word polarity orientation in an
unsupervised manner, using word embeddings.

- Weaknesses
The paper presents an interesting and useful idea, however, at this moment, it
is not applied to any test case. The ideas on which it is based are explained
in an ""intuitive"" manner and not thoroughly justified. 

- General Discussion
This is definitely interesting work. The paper would benefit from more
experiments being carried out, comparison with other methods (for example, the
use of the Normalized Google Distance by authors such as (Balahur and Montoyo,
2008) - http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4906796/) and the
application of the knowledge obtained to a real sentiment analysis scenario. At
this point, the work, although promising, is in its initial phase."
