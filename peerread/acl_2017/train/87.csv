PositionRank: An Unsupervised Approach to Keyphrase Extraction from Scholarly Documents,"The large and growing amounts of online scholarly data present both challenges and opportunities to enhance knowledge discovery. One such challenge is to automatically extract a small set of keyphrases from a document that can accurately describe the document's content and can facilitate fast information processing. In this paper, we propose PositionRank, an unsupervised  model for keyphrase extraction from scholarly documents that incorporates information from all positions of a word's occurrences into a biased PageRank. Our model obtains remarkable improvements in performance over PageRank models that do not take into account word positions as well as over strong baselines for this task.  Specifically, on several datasets of research papers, PositionRank achieves improvements as high as $29.09\%$.","{'IMPACT': '3', 'SUBSTANCE': '4', 'APPROPRIATENESS': '5', 'MEANINGFUL_COMPARISON': '4', 'SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS': '5', 'ORIGINALITY': '3', 'CLARITY': '5'}","- Strengths:
Nicely written and understandable.
Clearly organized. Targeted answering of research questions, based on 
different experiments.

- Weaknesses:
Minimal novelty. The ""first sentence"" heuristic has been in the summarization
literature for many years. This work essentially applies this heuristic
(evolved) in the keyword extraction setting. This is NOT to say that the work
is trivial: it is just not really novel.

Lack of state-of-the-art/very recent methods. The experiment on the system
evaluation vs state-of-the-art systems simply uses strong baselines. Even
though the experiment answers the question ""does it perform better than
baselines?"", I am not confident it illustrates that the system performs better
than the current state-of-the-art. This somewhat reduces the value of the
paper.

- General Discussion:
Overall the paper is good and I propose that it be published and presented. 

On the other hand, I would propose that the authors position themselves (and
the system performance) with respect to:
