Learning Cognitive Features from Gaze Data for Sentiment and Sarcasm Classification using Convolutional Neural Network,"Cognitive NLP systems- i.e., NLP systems that make use of behavioral data - augment traditional text-based features with cognitive features extracted from eye-movement patterns, EEG signals, brain-imaging etc. Such extraction of features is typically manual. We contend that manual extraction of features may not be the best way to tackle text subtleties that characteristically prevail in complex classification tasks like Sentiment Analysis and Sarcasm Detection, and that even the extraction and choice of features should be delegated to the learning system.  We introduce a framework to automatically extract cognitive features from the eye-movement/gaze data of human readers reading the text and use them as features along with textual features for the tasks of sentiment polarity and sarcasm detection. Our proposed framework is based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The CNN learns features from both gaze and text and uses them to classify the input text. We test our technique on published sentiment and sarcasm labeled datasets, enriched with gaze information, to show that using a combination of automatically learned text and gaze features often yields better classification performance over (i)  CNN based systems that rely on text input alone and (ii) existing systems that rely on handcrafted gaze and textual features.","{'IMPACT': '3', 'SUBSTANCE': '4', 'APPROPRIATENESS': '5', 'MEANINGFUL_COMPARISON': '3', 'SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS': '5', 'ORIGINALITY': '5', 'CLARITY': '5'}","- Strengths:

This paper tackles an interesting problem and provides a (to my knowledge)
novel and reasonable way of learning and combining cognitive features with
textual features for sentiment analysis and irony detection. The paper is 
clearly written and organized, and the authors provided a lot of useful detail
and informative example and plots. Most of the results are convincing, and the
authors did a good job comparing their approach and results with previous work.

- Weaknesses:

1. Just from the reading abstract, I expected that the authors' approach would
significantly outperform previous methods, and that using both the eye-gaze and
textual features consistently yields the best results. Upon reading the actual
results section, however, it seems like the findings were more mixed. I think
it would be helpful to update the abstract and introduction to reflect this. 
2. When evaluating the model on dataset 1 for sentiment analysis, were the
sarcastic utterances included? Did the model do better on classifying the
non-sarcastic utterances than the sarcastic ones?
3. I understand why the eye-movement data would be useful for sarcasm
detection, but it wasn't as obvious to me why it would be helpful for
(non-sarcastic) sentiment classification beyond the textual features. 

- General Discussion:

This paper contains a lot of interesting content, and the approach seems solid
and novel to me. The results were a little weaker than I had anticipated from
the abstract, but I believe would still be interesting to the larger community
and merits publication."

(1) A deep CNN framework is proposed to extract and combine cognitive features
with textual features for sentiment analysis and sarcasm detection. 

(2) The ideas is interesting and novelty.

- Weaknesses:

(1) Replicability would be an important concern. Researchers cannot replicate
the system/method for improvement due to lack of data for feature extraction. 

- General Discussion:

Overall, this paper is well written and organized. The experiments are
conducted carefully for comparison with previous work and the analysis is
reasonable. I offer some comments as follows.

(1)           Does this model be suitable on sarcastic/non-sarcastic utterances?
The
authors should provide more details for further analysis. 

(2)           Why the eye-movement data would be useful for
sarcastic/non-sarcastic
sentiment classification beyond the textual features? The authors should
provide more explanations."
