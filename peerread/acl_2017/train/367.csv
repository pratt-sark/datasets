From BLEU to RAINBOW: Why We Need New Metrics for NLG.,"The majority of NLG evaluation relies on automatic metrics, such as BLEU. In this paper, we investigate a wide range of these metrics, including state-of-the-art word-based and novel grammar-based ones, and demonstrate that they only weakly reflect human judgements of system outputs as generated by data-driven, end-to-end NLG. A detailed error analysis shows that automatic metrics are particularly bad in distinguishing outputs of medium and good quality, which can be partially attributed to the fact that human judgements and metrics are given on different scales. We also show that metric performance is data and system specific.  We then suggest an alternative metric, called RAINBOW, combining the individual strengths of different automatic scores. This new metric achieves up to rho=.81 correlation with human judgements on the sentence level (compared to a maximum of rho=.33  for existing metrics) and achieves stable results across systems and data sets.","{'IMPACT': '3', 'SUBSTANCE': '4', 'APPROPRIATENESS': '5', 'MEANINGFUL_COMPARISON': '3', 'SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS': '5', 'ORIGINALITY': '5', 'CLARITY': '4'}","- Strengths:

The paper addresses a long standing problem concerning automatic evaluation of
the output of generation/translation systems.

The analysis of all the available metrics is thorough and comprehensive.

The authors demonstrate a new metric with a higher correlation with human
judgements

The bibliography will help new entrants into the field.

- Weaknesses:

The paper is written as a numerical analysis paper, with very little insights
to linguistic issues in generation, the method of generation, the differences
in the output from a different systems and human generated reference.

It is unclear if the crowd source generated references serve well in the
context of an application that needs language generation.

- General Discussion:

Overall, the paper could use some linguistic examples (and a description of the
different systems) at the risk of dropping a few tables to help the reader with
intuitions."
