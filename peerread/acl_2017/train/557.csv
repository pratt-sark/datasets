End-to-End Neural Relation Extraction with Global Optimization,"Neural networks have recently shown promising results for relation extraction. State-of-the-art models cast the task as an end-to-end problem, solved incrementally using a local classifier. Yet previous work using statistical models have demonstrated that global optimization can achieve better performances compared to local classification. We build a globally optimized neural model for end-to-end relation extraction, proposing novel LSTM features in order to better learn representations. Experiments show that our model is highly effective, achieving the best performances on two standard benchmarks.","{'IMPACT': '4', 'SUBSTANCE': '4', 'APPROPRIATENESS': '5', 'MEANINGFUL_COMPARISON': '4', 'SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS': '3', 'ORIGINALITY': '3', 'CLARITY': '5'}","- Strengths:

 - The paper is clearly written and well-structured. 

 - The system newly applied several techniques including global optimization to
end-to-end neural relation extraction, and the direct incorporation of the
parser representation is interesting.

 - The proposed system has achieved the state-of-the-art performance on both
ACE05 and CONLL04 data sets.

 - The authors include several analyses.

- Weaknesses:

 - The approach is incremental and seems like just a combination of existing
methods.  

 - The improvements on the performance (1.2 percent points on dev) are
relatively small, and no significance test results are provided.

- General Discussion:

- Major comments:

 - The model employed a recent parser and glove word embeddings. How did they
affect the relation extraction performance?

 - In prediction, how did the authors deal with illegal predictions?

- Minor comments:

 - Local optimization is not completely ""local"". It ""considers structural
correspondences between incremental decisions,"" so this explanation in the
introduction is misleading.

 - Points in Figures 6 and 7 should be connected with straight lines, not
curves.

 - How are entities represented in ""-segment""?

 - Some citations are incomplete. Kingma et al. (2014) is accepted to ICLR,
and Li et al. (2014) misses pages."
