test_1128,"Second, due to the global structure, the test documents are mandatory in training.","they are inherently transductive and have difficulty with inductive learning, in which one can easily obtain word embeddings for new documents with new structures and words using the trained model.",reasoning
test_1129,"Despite that recent language encoders achieve promising performance, it is unclear if they perform equally well on text data with grammatical errors.",we synthesize grammatical errors on clean corpora to test the robustness of language encoders.,reasoning

test_1146,"Initially, we tried to fine-tune BERT (Devlin et al., 2019), but this did not work well, probably because we did not have enough data to perform the fine-tuning.","eventually we opted to use BERT (and variations thereof) as a sentence encoder, and to perform max-pooling on the penultimate layer to obtain a representation for an input piece of text.",reasoning

test_1151,It is relatively obvious that new models learn more distinctive unimodal representations compare to original models.,unimodal annotations can help the model to obtain more differentiated information and improve the complementarity between modalities.,reasoning
test_1152,"Different from joint training, meta-transfer learning computes the firstorder optimization using the gradients from monolingual resources constrained to the code-switching validation set.","instead of learning one model that is able to generalize to all tasks, we focus on judiciously extracting useful information from the monolingual resources.",reasoning
test_1153,"In multimodal context, sarcasm is no longer a pure linguistic phenomenon, and due to the nature of social media short text, the opposite is more often manifested via cross-modality expressions.",traditional text-based methods are insufficient to detect multimodal sarcasm.,reasoning

test_1171,"For example, on HellaSwag, the target hypothesis mode is only 8% better than the hypothesis only mode (58.8% versus 50.8%), which confirms that on this setting our zero-shot method is mainly taking advantage of the bias in the hypotheses.",we refrain from doing more zero-shot experiments on both datasets.,reasoning

test_1354,"In contrast, task boundaries in VisCOLL are unknown and ""smooth"" (i.e., with gradual transitions between tasks)-a setting that is closer to real-world situations.","visCOLL rules out many continual learning algorithms which require explicit task identity and boundary (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017;Rusu et al., 2016).",reasoning

test_1357,We find that (i) diversifying storage improves performance at the early stage of the stream but not in the later stages; (ii) prioritizing words likely to be forgotten does not improve performance.,future works should find a balance between storing more diverse or important examples and respecting original data distribution.,reasoning

test_1411,"Moreover, latent-variable models can represent multimodal distributions.","for these conditional tasks, the latent variable can be used as a source of stochasticity to ensure more diverse translations (Pagnoni et al., 2018) or answers in a dialogue (Serban et al., 2017).",reasoning

test_1497,"This ability, obviously, is not what we desire because 1) in real world applications, most entity mentions are new and unseen, which means out-of-dictionary mentions will dominate the test process; 2) because the training instances are very limited in open situations, it is too expensive to achieve high mention coverage; 3) many longtail mentions in the training set would be oneshot, i.e., the mention only appears once in the training data.",it is necessary to exploit whether NER models can still reach reasonable performance in low mention coverage situation.,reasoning
test_1498,"We believe this is because, as some previous studies in other tasks (Zhang et al., 2016;Lu et al., 2019) have pointed out, neural networks have strong ability and tendency to memorize training instances.","the high mention coverage will mislead the models to mainly memorize and disambiguate frequent entity names even though they are irregular, but ignore informative context patterns which are useful for generalization over unseen mentions.",reasoning
test_1499,"While most graph-structured data has a wide variety of inherent geometric structures, e.g. partially tree-like and partially cyclical, the above studies model the latent structures in a single geometry with a constant curvature, limiting the flexibility of the model to match the hypothetical intrinsic manifold.",using a product of different constant curvature spaces  might be helpful to match the underlying geometries of temporal knowledge graphs and provide high-quality representations.,reasoning

test_2636,"To address comprehension-based generation like generative QA, PALM uses the pre-training objectives that are closely related to the downstream tasks.",it differs from existing generative pre-training methods in that PALM goes beyond the solely autoencoding/autoregressive methods and combines the merits of autoencoding and autoregression in a single framework.,entailment
test_2637,"On the other hand, an autoregressive model, such as GPT (Radford, 2018;Radford et al., 2019), is only trained to encode unidirectional context (either forward or backward).","at each output timestep, a token is sampled from the model's predicted distribution and the sample is fed back into the model to produce a prediction for the next output timestep, and so on.",entailment

test_3998,"The additional classification task empowers our model to better capture the logicality in a story implicitly, namely, modeling the causal and temporal dependencies, inter-sentence coherence, and avoiding repetition.","and we generated stories using a topk sampling scheme (Fan et al., 2018) with k = 40 and a softmax temperature of 0.7 (Goodfellow et al., 2016) to balance the trade-off between diversity and fluency.",neutral
test_3999,"Some work has attempted to explicitly incorporate commonsense knowledge into language generation (Zhou et al., 2018;Guan et al., 2019;Yang et al., 2019b).","to leverage commonsense knowledge in pretrained language models, we resort to existing large-scale knowledge bases ConceptNet (Li et al., 2016b) and AtOMIC .",neutral
